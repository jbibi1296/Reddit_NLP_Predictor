2019-04-04 08:40:52,"Total Mobile Protection LCD Repair Cost?
I dropped my phone last night and while the screen was not cracked, the corner of it now has a bunch of dead pixels. I started filing a claim via Asurion since I have Total Mobile Protection, but I don't have an option to select ""LCD Replacement"" only Other. Since I know this doesn't fall under ""cracked screen"" (since the glass is fine and it's the LCD that needs to be replaced) I doubt it's going to be the same $29 replacement cost.

Has anyone had experience filing a claim with TMP and getting this particular issue repaired? If so, what was the pricing on it?

Also, are UbreakIfix no longer working with Asurion? I can't see any option to get the phone repaired locally no matter what ZIP I put in.

2019-04-04 02:25:01,"add device to data plan or use hotspot instead?
New iPad mini 5, bought from Apple.  Turns out the embedded SIM includes about every carrier you can imagine except Verizon.  How odd is that?  If I had known this I would not have bought a cell capable device.

So I need feedback deciding what to do with a device that has cell capability but apparently needs a VZ sim to use cell data.

Currently have 2 iPhones and shared Verizon plan, 2 GB/mo with carryover which is plenty for our average use.  Might need to bump it up for our 2 iPad's when on vacation.

I tried to add device via MyVerizon app and it wants to assign a phone number.  If I'm just using data why do I need a number?  That SIM &amp; Activation is $65.  Plus $10/mo added device.  Is that really required or is there a different type of SIM that I can get which is data only?

I am also considering simply using my iPhone as a hotspot.  Can anyone comment how efficient this is?  Will it suck up more of my data plan than if not used as hotspot?  If 2 iPads were connected to a iPhone hotspot would there be slow down issues?  Most of our data use is online reading, twitter, reddit, news sites, web surfing.  Video and streaming is rarely done.

Looking around this r/ I see posts about VZ pre-paid hotspot.  I didn't know VZ had this option, it might be even better than a hotspot using my current data plan since I'm likely to exceed my plan limit while on vacation.  

Be interested to get feedback on best options considering that primary use of cell would be on a vacation where wifi access is poor to none.",t3_b996je,verizon

2019-04-02 20:51:01,"Thinking of switching from T-Mobile. Trying to understand VZW promos.
So, I have a 4-line plan with T-Mobile. 

According to the VZ website, these are the incentives available. 

* $350 off an LG G8 (via bill credits)
* $200 prepaid gift card when selecting an unlimited plan.
* $300 or $450 credit for trade-in. 

According to an online chat with a VZ rep, all of these credits can stack, and they are good for each line that I port in. So, by my math, I am eligible for the following:

* $1400 off the price of 4 new G8 phones
* $800 in prepaid gift cards
* $450 +$300 +$300 +$300 in trade-in credits (iPhone 7+, iPhone 6, LG V20, LG G5).

**So in total, this adds up to $2750 in bill credits and $800 in gift cards.** 

Finally, I can get a 4-line GoUnlimited plan for $120/month with a military discount (would use my father-in-law's DD214)

Is my math correct? 

Do all of these things actually stack like the rep said they would? Seems a little too good to be true.

Is the GoUnlimited plan a decent plan? We live in a suburb of Los Angeles/San Diego so I don't think congestion is too much of a problem.

So here's a fun one. I am a small business owner (towing/recovery company) and have three phones (mine, wife, employee/driver) and there are two hum devices on the account, so five lines. That's the minimum to have a business account. I have the basic Verizon business plan, the details are below (as far as I know) taken from the following link. [https://www.verizonwireless.com/businessportals/support/faqs/plans/verizon-plan-for-business.html#g1](https://www.verizonwireless.com/businessportals/support/faqs/plans/verizon-plan-for-business.html#g1))

* Unlimited talk and text
* Unlimited International Messaging from the US
* Mobile Hotspot on capable devices
* Access to Corporate Email, including Exchange ActiveSync, Lotus Notes Traveler and GOOD for Enterprise at no additional cost
* 5GB of Verizon Cloud storage when you add it using the [Orders](https://b2b.verizonwireless.com/b2b/commerce/amsecure/orders.go) page in My Business

&amp;#x200B;

The hum devices should never have been sold to me, as per the HUM folks and as per the Verizon Fleet folks. I'm guessing the store just wanted to say ""yes"" as often as they could and wanted that sale. I've worked retail, I get it. The reason is the HUM devices require specifying year/make/model of vehicle, and they don't have the trucks that I own listed. I have a 2006 Ford F550 and a 2005 Mitsubishi Fuso Fk200. The Ford was set up as a 2006 Ford F-350, which worked fine, but the Mitsubishi got called a 2005 Mitsubishi Outlander.  This one would never log historical vehicle tracking, and it's our main truck, so I need to be able to see where it goes, not just in real-time. This issue is put to bed, don't need to focus on it, but that's the reason I need to return these. 

&amp;#x200B;

Now, I stopped by the verizon store that sold me the units and they said they'd be able to refund me the cost of the units and any monthly fees I've paid for them, but they wanted to have their business/fleet team reach out to me first.  I just spoke to that team on the phone and their solution is too expensive. So I'll be returning these.

&amp;#x200B;

Here's my biggest problem with this situation:  They said dropping below 5 lines would disallow me from having a business account any more. I told him that I would not be okay with that as by no fault of mine did these HUM devices not work for me; I did nothing except try to use these units in good faith. The guy said that even if an override was made, every month 'the system' would kick me back to a personal account, so there's no way to reliably, long-term, keep my business account with less than 5 lines. I don't believe that any company as successful as Verizon would make a software system that isn't customizable to suit the needs of customers such as I'm asking, even if the person who can make it happen is four or fourteen levels above the store manager and doesn't often pull levers like I'd be asking of him/her/they/them. 

&amp;#x200B;

1: How can I keep my business account with three lines?

2: If I cannot keep my business account, is it reasonable to ask for a discount on a non-business account as compensation for the loss of features? If so, how?

What can I do from here because sitting on hold for the next hour to argue with some rep on why I’m sticking with AppleCare and not their shit is going to piss me off. ",t3_b8b0hy,verizon

So Verizon...moved over to them from T-mobile where I was really happy (and had been for 12 years) 4 years ago due to work using Verizon and not wanting to deal with 2 phones. Been a good customer all this time on a 2 GB plan that suited my needs.

THEN I made the colossal of listening to one of their reps 2 months ago when I ran over my 2GB grandfathered plan...move over to this plan, it's 5 GB and it costs less..no, nothing will change with your plan...it will save you $7.00 a month and give you more data...(heavy sigh)..... he forgets to mention I now have to pay for additional line that I don't need, how convenient for his commission; especially with the phone I purchased at same time, his misleading statements really helped his pocketbook. I call back last week to try and resolved issue, ask to speak to supervisor. Rep puts me on hold for 10 mins, then comes back and says supervisor on escalation call, but offered resolution of 6 month credit for the extra line, and will submit a ticket for removal of the extra line with the credit to cover it until that happens.

Get next months bill, no credit and extra line still on there. So the rep tries to tell me that she's sorry the rep made an error, and she can see the rep's notes, but she can't do anything. I speak with supervisor, who proceeds to tell me, yes, the rep made big error, but what she can do for me is give me a plan with less data now to come to the originally agreed on price, and no, it's not my grandfathered plan, I lost that when I believed the original inept lying first rep. So essentially, for my being a loyal customer...I get lies, more lies, a bigger bill which they will magnimoniously allow me to trade in for a lesser plan than sold with phone.

Guess who's keeping the phone free of charge from here on out for all my trouble? Guess who has lots of documentation? Guess who's filing in small claims court to cover the cost of the phone that will go on my credit? Guess who's copying and pasting this on yelp and every other review site I can find?

Guess who's no longer a LOYAL VERIZON CUSTOMER??? Yeah, you got that right!!!",t3_b8mkm0,verizon
2019-04-01 17:37:14,"Optimizing for 2 lines and new phones, is BOGO even worth it?
So I just missed out the most recent BOGO, but I'm sure another will come along soon enough and I want to be ready to take advantage. Current setup:

* line1: iPhone 6s on Verizon Prepaid, 3GB $40.75/mo (uses \~200MB/mo, I'm always on wifi)
* line2: Nexus 5x on Google Fi, \~$35/mo (uses \~1GB/mo)

Looking to replace them with an XS Max and XR, respectively.

So to take advantage of a BOGO I've got that Fi line to port in, but I'd also need to put both lines on a postpaid plan I believe. If I choose the new shared S plan (2gb) that is $**75**/mo (plus unknown access fees etc), or the M plan (4gb) for $**90**/mo *postpaid*. This compares to 3GB each line for $**60**/mo on a *prepaid* plan.

So the $15-$30/mo difference (besides having a lot less data) adds up to $15\*24=$**360**  or $30\*24=$**720** wasted over the 24mo I'd be receiving statement credits for that GetOne device...a $749 XR.

Am I missing something about these BOGO deals where I could save a lot more money, or are they just not that great for people in my situation?

Additionally: I'd normally sell my old devices on craigslist/ebay to get top resale dollar for them, but my 6s touchscreen is starting to fail which will drastically drive the price down, so maybe taking the trade-in cash if that if offered is worth it this time.",t3_b89jpv,verizon

I had a similar situation with an old Galaxy S4 but I was under the impression this was because of the Verizon system upgrades (finally moving out of the CDMA Stone age). I didn't expect a phone as new as the V20 to be affected though.

Hello,

I have a rather large family plan, 10 lines (new Verizon unlimited plan), all lines are smartphones. I was going through and looking to potentially add a tablet to my account, and it appears that it will let me finalize the order. I get to the checkout screen, and I just have to click that I agree to the payment terms and the amount due will go through with my billing choice.

&amp;#x200B;

Did Verizon recently increase the number of lines a consumer account can have? Will I be able to add a tablet, or will the order go through and end up getting cancelled, or will I just have problems activating the device?

I ""cheaped out"" on internet when I moved into this house a few months ago and got 100/100.

I'm also using an Edgerouter X router + Ubiquiti UAP-AC-PRO wireless access point that I already had.  

We tested when it was installed and I got that advertised speed.  I don't think I've tested in the meantime, but I got tired of the speed and upgraded to gigabit, which was supposed to take effect today.  

Did a speedtest to check and I'm getting about 27/5, so not even the speed I was paying for *before*.  

Power cycled all the equipment and went through the ""slow speed"" wizard on Verizon's site, which didn't help.  Got into a chat support session and the agent wouldn't do a single thing but try to push me to buy their router.

I'm not stupid, I know my equipment is capable of well over the speed I'm getting (although the router functionally caps out around 500/500).  Anyone know the magic words to get them to provide any support?


I even asked if I could plug the ethernet cable from the ONT directly into a computer to test the speed without the router involved, and he said something about ""we need the router to boost the speed"" which doesn't make any sense.

Would rather not drop $200 on a new router when my existing equipment is already capable, especially since I just raised my bill with the upgrade anyway.  Wish I had tested the speeds on ""100/100"" more recently...",t3_b8cr9y,verizon

So my wife and I have GUDP plans with an employee discount. We get this discount as my mother was a longtime corporate employee who retired.

The big change from the 50% discount to 25% discount has really hit us hard. We are paying nearly $140 now for two lines. Seeing T-Mobile's offers to buy out our device payment plans and offer two lines of unlimited data (with free netflix and hotspot) for $60 seems like it would be a no-brainer at this point. I don't even have hotspot with our GUDP plans at all, and had to root phones to get around this - and I'm no longer in a position to root our phones, unfortunately.

I can set up the Unifi AP's behind the Fios router for mobile devices and leave the Fios wifi solely for the media client (TV), but it still doesn't help with the choppy signal. Nothings worse than having the movie freeze in the middle of an action scene. I do know that Verizon has their own extenders, but thats not something I want to entertain.
