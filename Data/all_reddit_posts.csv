"SIM card - $25 ripoffEvery time I call T-Mobile they tell me how important I am to them. I'm an 8 year post-paid customer, never late with a payment, average bill of $100. TMobile, you  can keep your Mobile Tuesday promos - I could give a rip about your silly Taco Bell coupons. And I don't care about the ""dedicated"" support team assigned to my account. You can keep them both. Just don't take advantage of me when I call you because I need a $0.50 piece of plastic from you. It makes me resentful enough that I feel like it might be time to look at other carriers. ",1

"Connectivity issues on non-LTE/4GI recently switched to T-mobile from Google Fi.  I was already on the T-mobile network 99% of the time on Fi.  My wife and I brought our own Moto x4 devices and I signed up over the phone.  I activated both phones with T-Mobile SIMs and they seemed to work OK for a couple of hours once we had our numbers ported.  My wife's device is still working well.

&#x200B;

I started having problems where my phone would not work with wifi calling (I got a couple errors) and the phone would show service on 2G/3G networks but would not calls or send SMS messages.  I swapped SIM cards at the local T-Mobile store (no cost) but this did not fix the problems.  I then bought a Galaxy S10e hoping that this would fix it all.  The new S10e was activated in store with another new SIM and functioned fine on LTE and Wifi calling once home, but as soon as I hit a non-LTE area the device displays bars (and a signal app I have shows service) but gives me an error: not registered on network.  It also says that I am unable to send SMS.  I have tried factory resetting the phone, restarting, toggling airplane mode on and off, and resetting network settings with no success.

&#x200B;

I have called tech support 2x and both times they checked some network settings on their end, had my restart the phone, and had me reset network settings.  Both times I was ultimate able to make a call on 2G but the issues came back within minutes.

&#x200B;

I like T-Mobile, but if I cant make calls/send messages that doesn't really matter.  I am hoping SOMEONE out there can point me in the right direction, because tech support isn't of much use and I feel like I might be missing something here.

I can't send text messages for some reason though, even though my Wifi is working fine. I get the message, ""No signal found for mobile networks.""

"T-Mobile Employees/Managers - Any discount advice?UPDATE: Chatted with support online today and they applied a $25 credit to my account for my trouble. I’ll take it! 

Curious if any current or past employees have any advice on how to cut my phone bill when I head back to the store tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Went in to T-Mobile today to take advantage of my JUMP upgrade. Tech was nice, offered me 25% (he said it was his employee discount) right out of the gate for accessories. 45 minutes go by, and, due to some kind of error with their system they can't process my upgrade without needlessly charging me extra for my phone. No problem - I'll try another store. 

EDIT: For context, the system wasn’t recognizing I’d paid off 50% of the cost of my phone and was trying to make me pay an additional $180 even though I only have 4 payments left. 

&#x200B;

I walk a couple blocks to the second T-Mobile store. Another 20-30 minutes go by, and these folks are facing the same account issue and can't process my upgrade. They offer me a 15% discount on accessories (no surprise there is some flexibility here in what the store is willing to offer). 

&#x200B;

Considering  I'll have made a minimum of 3 trips to T-Mobile by tomorrow, and wasted a good 2+ hours of time,  I'm wondering what is a reasonable discount I should ask for when it comes time for brass tacks. I know in the past I've been able to knock off set up fees and get accessory discounts here and there. Any advice on what's a realistic range/the most you've seen knocked off?",1

"Disable Forwarding to Voicemail for Roaming?I have a TMO line on a friend's account. In the past he called customer service to disable voicemail on the line. It would ring indefinitely and never be forwarded anywhere.

Today I checked it and it went to voicemail after ringing for a while. So I try the short code to disable conditional forwarding ""##004#"" and it doesn't work. The T-Mobile DOC says that it ""Cancel call forwarding to voicemail (prevents new voicemail messages)"". So why doesn't it?

Source: https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-4041

The reason I don't want voicemail is that when I am roaming internationally I still want the phone to ring. If conditional forwarding activates one is automatically charged a minute of voice roaming. In some cases roaming is $5.99 a minute so it's a big deal.

**Edit:** This is a real issue: ""If your phone is on when you get an incoming call, even if you don't answer it and it goes to voicemail, the call is charged one minute for the call coming in to the phone.""

"Help for understanding options for dual sim to combine personal and work phone on TMo and ATT lines?I currently have an iPhone 7 on T-Mobile postpaid for my personal phone. 

I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S7 on AT&T for my work phone through my company.

I’m due for an upgrade on both. Upgrading the T-Mobile phone is on my dime, upgrading the AT&T phone is on my company. 

Goal: I despise carrying 2 phones and want to take advantage of dual SIM to combine both lines into one phone.

My understanding is that to use dual SIM with two different carriers, the phone MUST be unlocked and therefore paid off. I’d prefer to upgrade my AT&T phone to iPhone XR and run my T-Mobile in that as an ESIM. But the phone won’t be unlocked as my company is making payments on it and I see T-Mobile does not officially support postpaid ESIM yet. Second choice is to upgrade my personal iPhone to a T-Mobile iPhone XR which will run me about 20 a month, but sounds like I won’t be able to use the AT&T ESIM as that also won’t be unlocked until it’s paid off.

Is my only option to buy an iPhone XR unlocked outright, put my current T-Mobile SIM card in that, then have my AT&T SIM card transferred to ESIM and put that in? Or am I missing other possible options?

The cell phone administrator at my company does not even know what dual SIM is and I had to explain it to her when I asked about it, so I’m not expecting any help there. She pretty much said “we can’t do that” I’m sure just because of lack of understanding. The ESIM transfer seems pretty easy on AT&T and can be done online, so I’m hoping if I give her step by step instructions on how to order one then that would take care of it. Ultimately I just don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new phone only to find out it was a waste because I can’t get dual SIM working... if I can’t do this I’m just gonna ride this iPhone 7 into the ground since it’s paid off. 

Thanks so much in advance for any input. ",1

"Deprioritization & Network LatencyMy first hand experience with deprioritization shows that network latency may be increased when deprioritized, depending on congestion at any given time. When the tower is more congested, the amount of latency variation can be significant for short periods of time. However, under normal loads, not much variation should be observed:

1) [deprioritized line](https://i.imgur.com/Y8fjkS8.jpg) 
vs [non-depriortized line](https://i.imgur.com/4y9pUEG.jpg)

* MIN ping 3-6ms better
* AVG ping 4-7ms better
* MAX ping 12-22ms better
* MEDIAN ping, 5ms better

Research also appears to show that carriers use QoS for network management based on 3GPP standards:

[LTE QoS Link 1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13638-016-0565-9) 

[LTE QoS Link 2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210310)

Further research indicates all carriers may reduce speed when you're deprioritized &amp; the network is congested and it may also result in increased latency:

[AT&amp;T (explicit)](https://about.att.com/sites/broadband/network)
&gt;During periods of congestion, these customers may experience **reduced data speeds and increased latency** as compared to other customers using the same cell site (“Congestion-based Data Management”)

[Sprint (explicit)](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/open-internet-information.html)
&gt;Customers subject to de-prioritization may experience **reduced throughput and increased latency** compared to other customers on the constrained site and as compared to their normal experience on the Sprint network

[Verizon (implicit)](https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/what-network-latency)
&gt;Any number of factors can contribute to network latency, **including the speed and available bandwidth on the network, or the sheer size of the transmitted data packet**

[T-Mobile (no mention)](https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/policies/internet-service)
&gt;Heavy Data Users will have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.

Another person told me that this video proves that T-Mobile's deprioritization does not increase network latency at all and it only reduces throughput. Please discuss how, if any, network latency is influenced with T-Mobile's QoS and deprioritization (during light and heavy congestion).

Anyone Else Having This Issue?,1
"Ongoing Issue With My Phone's Data ConnectionHi, I'm posting this here today in an attempt to maybe find out if anyone else is having the problem as I am because I've spoken to T-Mobile's team of experts regarding the problem and they are just at a loss for any sort of solution.

For the past 3 months my phone has had little to no internet on the weekdays from 8am to 3pm. I'm on the One Plus plan right now and also pay an additional $10 for more Mobile Hotspot data so I'm essentially missing out on all of these perks 5 days out of the week for 7 hours each day.

The issue occurs specifically at the time frame I've listed above and hasn't changed. I called T-Mobile tech support for at least the 20th time yesterday and they finally pinpointed the issue being that my SIM card attempts to connect to two separate cell towers and the signal essentially bounces back and forth for several hours straight, leaving me with no data service. They've also noted that it occurs during low congestion times so too many users connecting to the towers isn't the problem either.

I just don't know what to do at this point. I've tried everything the support team has suggested and they've sent on 4 separate tickets on this issue and have no solution for the problem; I've tried resetting my APN/Network settings, replacing the SIM card, but still every Monday to Friday from 8am to 3pm my data connection is basically non-existent and I'm left with no internet for nearly half the day. The only thing I can do is make calls and send texts.

What can I do to fix this?

EDIT - Tried Factory Reset to revert to an older software version to see if this was interfering with my data connection all along since it may potentially be my phone that is preventing it from connecting to a tower properly. It's a little after 8am right now and everything seems to be functioning properly so fingers crossed!",1

"Samsung s9 Tmobile issue with stock email program - not receiving random emailsI'm having the strangest problem, which is serious enough that it has me very concerned. In the last few months, I've noticed that the Samsung stock email app just completely misses downloading random work emails. I have it set up via Exchanges AcriveSync, push retrieval. In the last few months, I've seen this happen on three separate occasions. 

I learned about the first two occasions when I went to my desktop Outlook and saw an email that never showed up on my stock email app. I immediately went back to the app, refreshed it, but still didn't see the email. 

I removed the work email account from the stock email app, and re added it. The app then downloaded the missing email. Same thing happened on the second occasion. 

I opened a ticket with my company's IT provider, but they said it's a problem with my phone and that I should switch to a different app. 

Worried, I downloaded Blue mail and have been running it in parallel with the stock app. Just an hour ago, the same thing happened. The email showed up in Bluemail, but never arrived in the stock email app.

Should I just upgrade quickly to the s10, hoping this is not a systemic software problem? I was hoping to wait until the 5G version is released. But this issue may force my hand.",1

"What's going on with T-Mobile's EIP Payment Structurehttps://imgur.com/a/Z40JxFE

Earlier today I noticed all phones are available for $0 down and on 36 month installments in the app, including latest Samsung Galaxy phones. Now later in the day, it seems all phones are back to 24 month installments and with higher downpayments. even on the main website where they typically would advertise their 36 month plans for the lower monthly payments, now show 24 months. 

Are they getting rid of the 36 month option? Or will we noe get the option to choose between 24/36? 

If so, will we also get to choose between $0 down and higher monthly cost, or downpayment and lower monthly cost? 
or will those depend on the 24/36 month option?

Doesn't seem T-Mobile is sure of what to do thenselves; lots of changes to their payment structure recently.

My account is considered super well qualified, but the prices being shown now seem like the standard prices. 

The ones I saw earlier with $0 down on everything made a lot more sense, even with 36 months. Which is the only option I had prior to today, and now its back to 24 months but higher downpayments. Note sure if this an error, new change, or just my account. 

Has anyone else noticed any changes to their pricing recently?",1

Jump on Demand issueI just got a new Galaxy S10 plus through Jump on Demand. Of course I traded in my S9 Plus. On this month's bill I am being charged for both phones. I have gotten two different answers from T-Mobile Representatives. One representative said that the S9 plus charge would fall off of my bill by it's due date. Another representative said that it is normal to be charged for both phones. Her reasoning was that I used the S9 Plus for the majority of the month before trading it. That makes no sense to me. If that's the case why am I being charged a full month for the S10 Plus? I'm pretty sure I had this same exact issue when I traded my Note 8 for the S9 Plus. They had to go in and remove the Note 8 for my account even though I had given the phone back in the store. Has anyone else had issues with this? I've got some time before my bill is due but I like nipping things in the bud. If all else fails I guess I will go back into the store.

I reported a few weeks ago that B71 towers are popping up around Rochester, NY. Still none close enough to my house for a signal.... until waking up today!


My only question is why is my S9+ phone treating B71 like B12, where if the signal is stronger, it still picks up a weaker B2 or B4 as the main connection? Is it because it's only 5MHz?


Weakest location in my house is my kitchen because the brick chimney blocks the LOS to the tower. I'm getting a cool 2 mbps down / 500 kbps upload. Was hoping B71 would fix this but I'm still on B2. Was even hoping for better since it says I'm connected to B2 LTE-A.

I saw other solutions to bring it into the store, but with Costco I guess it has to be mailed in. Does anyone know if this would pass with assurant or should I not even try it? Also if it is rejected as a trade in, does that invalidate the whole terms of the promo? 
Thanks in advance! ",1
"Coverage issues for the last month or so.Myself and the other person on this plan have ASUS phones (ZenFone ar and ZenFone 5z respectively). Our coverage was never 100% perfect, but in the last month-month and a half, we've had almost no coverage in areas that worked just fine in the past. We have to find the one spot in any location to actually make calls from, and it can still take up to 30 seconds to actually connect.
I also can't seem to receive text messages half the time I'm connected to wi-fi. 

This is extremely frustrating, as we both love our phones, and switching to something like a galaxy would actually be a pretty severe downgrade in specs. If T-Mobile has suddenly decided not to play well with ASUS phones.

Has T-Mobile coverage improved dramatically from iPhone 5 to iPhone SEI had T-Mobile for a short time 3 years ago. My wife and I had an iPhone 5 and a 5c. Coverage was not great in Tulsa; we had absolutely no signal in some places. So we switched back to AT&T. We are considering going back. Now we have an SE and a 7.

"Seeking adviceI'm thinking about bringing over 4 lines from Verizon. I will also be bringing my own unlocked phones. I'm currently paying about $190 per month, and if I take advantage of the 3 lines for the price of 2 promotion, I'd save about $65 per month once you factor in the free Netflix. 

I went to Costco today to sign up, but didn't realize that the 3 for the price of 2 promo wasn't available through them. So... Would I be better off paying the $100 for my 4 SIM cards through tmobile.com, or getting the free SIM cards from Costco and paying the extra $20 per month? I also see that they are offering $50 Costco gift cards per line, so that's another $200 to consider. 

I'm also eligible for Amplified through my company, and we have an option to get One Plus on all 4 lines for $160 per month. 

Is there something obvious that I'm missing? I feel like just getting the line through Costco to save money on the SIM cards and $200 in Costco gift cards is a better deal than saving $20 with the ""3 for 2"" deal. I think I can covert the Costco plan over to my company's Amplified deal once everything is all set up, too.

"Switch to T-Mobile from Sprint iPhone Forever plan???My uninsured iPhone XR was recently stolen and I'm thinking through my options. I lease the phone through the  Sprint iPhone Forever plan and would be eligible for a new upgrade in September. I owe roughly $500 on the phone so not sure if I have to buy it outright to make up for it being stolen PLUS buy a new phone or if I can purchase a different XR and return that when my lease is up even though the serial numbers will be different.

Just saw that T-Mobile is offering a free iPhone XR for new lines. Wondering if it would make more sense to pay off my remaining lease, switch to T-Mobile to get the new phone promo and stay on their service.

I'm happy with Sprint's service (in DC) but at my wits end with their customer service. I'd like to keep unlimited everything plan and really like the fact that I get free text/2G data when traveling abroad. Currently pay ~$70 a month, which includes $30 for the phone lease and $40 for the plan.

Anyone know how the ETF reimbursement process would work or have any other insights that would prove helpful? With the merger looming, I'm just trying to think through best options as I'd rather not spend >$1000 on a new phone on top of replacing the other items that I was robbed of. ",1

"Worth working here considering experience?Found out a couple weeks ago my job is coming to an end. I had worked for Best Buy for 2+ years before my current job in which I’ve been at for over a year (also sales role with electronics) along with some previous department store experience. 



I notice most T-Mobile openings I’ve applied to are only part time, does this ever change? I’ve been FT the last 4 years, are hours usually scarce? 




I know this isn’t a “must have experience” type of role considering a lot of people seem to get this job straight out of HS or with little experience, but can you make a good amount of money here? I was making $17/hr (I live in LA) at my current job, and have already figured I’m most likely taking a pay cut with most jobs I’ve been leaning towards. I saw its base pay + commission from what I could tell online, so I’m kinda hoping I can at least average out at $15-17 an hour.

(I'm a little OOTL on T-Mobile right now, haven't paid much attention to what happened to Jump or anything in the past year)

So I just realized I only have about $165 left to pay off on my Galaxy S9+.   I thought now might be a good time to pay it off, so I could still sell it for ~$400; then jump to maybe an LG V40 or OnePlus 6T.  (I like the pro camera features of LGs phones, and the clean android of the 6T).

So the question is, could I pay off/purchase my S9+ for $165, then immediately start a new Jump lease on a different phone? Or would my only option be a standard EIP?

"Northern NC Service IssuesThis is a long story that goes back to December 11th 2018 so I'll try to shorten it.. 

Originally we were on Metro in December using 2x LG Stylo 4's. We noticed immediately between 7pm to 10am(on 3 different towers) it would commonly lock on to 4-5 bar band 71 with no service, try to connect to 1 bar of HSPA+ or 2 bar Band 12 but ends up with no service at all til next morning. I complained to customer support for a month and sent an email to John Legere with no response from T-Force.  I filed a FCC complaint because we couldn't even make a phone call(No one I talked to could even understand what a Band was.)

After speaking with Metro corporate they sent out ""Engineers"" and couldn't even find the towers at first(Metro Corporate doesn't know what a Band is either.) They even had a T-Mobile Engineering Manager from Charlotte call me. In the end they moved the antennas around a couple times and Metro decided they don't know what's wrong and can't fix it. So corporate refunded me and politely told me to go away..

I had researched back and forth to try to help them diagnose the issue and one theory I had was that it might be network prioritization. So on March 5th I switched directly to official T-Mobile service but unfortunately that did not fix it. On Mar 22nd I bought a Moto G7 Power and the issue continues(it confirmed the Stylo 4's were never the issue though.)

Due to a TV station in Hickory T-Mobile only has 5mhz of Band 71 until they move in September then 20mhz will be available. This area is rural low population with only having Verizon coverage for years, so I doubt everyone bought new phones in 2018 and switched to T-Mobile to congest that 5mhz. T-Mobile had only just littered the rural Stokes county area with Band 71 in December 2017.

It's like a giant puzzle I can't figure out because I have no access to the back end to diagnose it myself. The ""Engineers"" around here appear to be the same as a Cable Service Tech. I need an actual Engineer that can see what's going on and not fiddle with the Antennas; it's not a signal issue.

I only have two theories left:
1. They were being cheap and Band 71 towers here are aimed at older congested base stations in the Mayodan/Madison NC area or King, NC.
2. They setup a base station beside of Verizon's up here and it has shared backhaul bandwith, so people on Verizon are actually causing the congestion(because on Verizon it's painfully slow after 7pm.)

It was enough to get $300 off of her device. We were paying monthly for the new device and so they were supposed to take off $15 each month from our bill payments.


The tricky part was that my wife returned the iPhone 8 to get the iPhone 8+ because it had more camera features. They did not re-apply the $15 reduction each month when she did that.

We just recently paid off the phone in full and called them about the $300 and they said they would credit us the $300 in about a month but they haven't. It's been two months since they said that.

Effects of the Sprint and T-mobile merge on New Employees?,1
"Question for RF engineersHi,

I am curious why does T-Mobile still utilize band 2 when they can just use band 25 and also have devices be compatible with Sprint/other roaming partners?  Why limit the device to only B2 in the 1900 range?

Also, for AT&T why do they use band 17, when band 12 covers all of the frequencies of band 17?  

Why doesn't the FCC just remove the legacy bands (2, 4, 17, etc) and reclassify the supersets as the ones carriers can use going forward?  It's going to become quite complicated to manage all of these bands.  It's silly to say devices support bands 2 and 25 when technically band 25 supports everything band 2 does and more.

"My last 2 weeks with T-MobileI don’t know if this kind of post is allowed, because it is purely a complaint, but the experience I’ve had over the last 2 weeks with this company is something that I think needs to be shared.

Let me preface with this; all we wanted was to port a line from boost mobile.  Simple enough.  Walked into a T-Mobile store... fairly straight forward.  

To not make this a long narrative story, (but it’s still long) here’s the list of events that followed,

Ported line became my Apple Watch line.  
Apple watches were disconnected from our phones.  
Representative disappears for over an hour.  
Number removed from Apple Watch.  
We’re told everything is back to normal, wait 24 hrs.  
New number won’t receive calls.  
Return to mobile store and spend another 2 hrs attempting to port the number.  
Told it’s fixed, wait 24 hrs.  
New number won’t receive calls.  
Return to mobile store, cancel and restart all affected numbers.  
4 more hrs, finally get a call to come through on the ported number and leave... satisfied.  
Next morning primary phone doesn’t have data and I call to fix have it “turned on”.  
Login to my T-Mobile to check the status of our account to find the primary account holder had been switched to the ported line.  
Call to have that fixed... find I can’t login to my T-Mobile because my email is now associated with another line? Given a ticket number and told I’ll be called back.  
Return from trip abroad while this is happening and call to discontinue T-Mobile one plus and am told I do not have it enabled on my line.  
Ask for the service to be refunded  because I didn’t receive the service.  
An Apple Watch won’t connect to lte.  
Call to have that fixed; along with my email issue which has not been resolved.  
New EID is pushed and... back end email footprint is wiped?  
Same issue with Apple Watch the next day.   Same resolution.  
Can finally login with my email and I check the account status.  See I have T-Mobile one plus?  Call to cancel again.  
Another issue with a different Apple Watch on our plan today. Can’t connect, line reinstated...  
Apple Watch has two digit numbers? Get the extra removed...  
Mobile app/web app still don’t work right ever since the port.  Logging in reveals a bunch of user loading errors.  Customer service reps seem baffled by it.  

I feel like I’m loosing my mind.  I know there’s something deeply wrong with my account and I don’t know what to do.  Every day is at least an hour typing or on the phone with customer service for something new.

This may be a shit post... but goddammit fuck you T-Mobile.

So I’m wondering if it is band 4 why didn’t they do it during the initial upgrade and why place it on it’s on rack.

"Does anyone else feel like iPhone users are screwed on T-mobile?My wife and kids all use iPhones - an iPhone 8 (wife), SE (son) and 5s (daughter).  I am looking to buy my daughter and son a better iPhone.  The whole add a line, get $750 got me thinking - 1 that I wish I could have taken advantage of it (my wife's phone is only half paid off and too valuable to trade in, and of course the SE and 5s weren't eligible) - I wish I had had an iPhone 6/6s - and 2 I didn't really want a new line (or have to play games with Costco deal).  The kids don't always get receptions where they need it and I don't want to buy them new iPhone XR. 

There are really no used phones out there that have all the bands: the 8 - which is more than I am looking to spend on a kids phone - doesn't have band 71.  The 6s, SE and 7 are missing 66 & 71, the 6 is missing 12, 66 & 71 - so that is out for sure).  (You can get the SE new on clearance right now for a decent price - $300 with 128gb - and $50 less for 32gb).  

I keep looking at Verizon (they have some really good deals to move over) - but I have a pretty good plan ($120 SCNA 10GB - upgraded to unlimited data) - and I don't want to give it up to play the switching game - as I'll never be able to get back to that plan.   I may try calling T-mobile, but at what I am paying, I suspect I am not a good enough customer to try to keep or give me any breaks!  I've started saving some each month (what I would save by not switching to Verizon!) to upgrade the phones to at least iPhone 8's - but that will take a while.

A few questions 

* what do/would y'all do? 
* I don't think Android is an option, but would be curious if you've switched - how did it go?  iMessage is the killer for my kids and they also have iPads - I keep writing Tim Cook - I'd even pay a subscription for iMessage.  But maybe I need to get more serious about switching from Apple.
* how important are bands 66 & 71?  (In the Houston area?)
* looking at something like h2o wireless (AT&T MVNO) as a pretty cheap (like $3 per month) stop gap - and pick up a cheap SE.  Anyone know how the SE (it appears to have all the ATT band - but not totally sure) work on ATT?  But hate doing this considering I have T-mobile lines for them - and eventually the data will be really important to them, but they can live with texting while out and wifi/iMessage from home for now",1

My husband & I have 2 lines with att, currrently paying $160 incl tax for 2 iphone x & 15 g data. We’ve been looling to switch to tmo to potentially save some money. Our iphone’s have about a year of payments left. Can we combine carrier freedom & the 2 for 100/110? It seems like the best deal so far. If we can’t combine the deals then is there a scenario where we have 2 lines & 2 iphones for about $130 or less/month?

the phone app only lets you set passcodes, but does let you see the LTE strength so you can determine the ideal placement.

On my third replacement in less than a year because they just stop working. So figured I’d get the new one to try out, cancel out the prepaid line I have for one of them, and continue to pay the same $10 a month for the newer style. But then I see I’d have to pay $25 for a “SIM Starter Kit” and just said never mind. Why not just call it an Activation Fee and stop beating around the bush.  
 
On the [T-Mobile site](https://www.t-mobile.com/internet-device/t-mobile-syncup-drive-2) it says under “in the box”

"With the introduction of home internet service, will we see more EIP of more home-based hardware?Now that T-Mobile is positioning itself into being an ISP for the home, do you think they will (or should) start offering products that can also be purchased using the 24-36 month EIP financing they’ve been traditionally doing for smartphones, tablets, and accessories?

If anything, it would be a good way to retain their customer base from churn, and give low to middle-income families and individuals an opportunity to get better things for the home without having to front the entire amount or put it on their credit cards, including but not limited to TVs, game consoles, laptops, etc.

They’ve already started with smart home products, so this seems like a next logical step in that direction.

"T-Mobile Screwed me over big timeI walked into a T-Mobile store to ask about the Carrier Freedom promotion. As I wanted to get the S10+ and have T-Mobile pay off my current Pixel 3XL device that I got through Google Fi. I was assured twice once in store and over the phone at the time of purchasing the phone that Google Fi qualifies for the promo, Got my S10+ new plan through T-Mobile and all is well for a few days. I go to the link to check out the steps in the process to get the phone back to them and the turn around time for me to get the card to pay off the 3XL, I enter my number and the system say that I am eligible for the carrier freedom. I click the get started button on the page and I keep getting and error ""Stating that I didn't get my phone back to them in time so I don't qualify for the promotion.

So I call customer service and speak to a rep who informs me that phones coming from Google Fi don't qualify for the promotion, I explained to her that I was reassured ""twice"" that I qualify, she said that because Google Fi uses T-Mobile towers and users under the Google Fi umbrella don't qualify for the Promo. I said ok so why was I told twice that I qualify? I already canceled service with Google ported my number over and purchased a new phone what am I supposed to do. She tells me that I can send the phone back and get my money back, I explained that is not an option as I owe google $624.00 for the phone and I won't get service until I pay that balance off. She puts me on hold and tells me that she spoke to a supervisor and nothing can be done sorry.

I spoke to another rep that told me the same thing. I spoke to Google Fi rep and she was upset with the issue, She had me do a 3way call with T-Mobile asked to speak with a supervisor and explained Google Fi is a service provider and said that because I was assured that I would get the Promo they have to honor it. After trying to dodge for a few mins the supervisor said that she will note my account I can take my final Google  bill and phone to a store so they can see the physical bill and they will call and it can be processed.

This was yesterday. I called today to verify that the notes are on my account then the rep ask to put me on hold. I explained to her that I already went through this with 2 reps and a supervisor yesterday. She said she understood and put me on hold, yep came back with the same explanation I said you guys messed up ok fine mistakes happen. But you guys should honor this cause I made the switch because you T-Mobile told me that I am qualified. She then tells me there is no way to override the system from her end. I said cool can you transfer me to the Carrier freedom side so I can speak to someone. Put me on hold and came back with the same story telling me that there is no way to fix this and they are sorry. I ask then why is Google Fi an option when searching the list of qualified carriers no one can answer me that question, I will potentially be out $624.00 if they don't honor this promotion. They keep saying sorry our mistake we gave you bad info twice but no one is trying to fix it. I had T-Mobile for many years I would leave and come back they always had the best plans and Customer service was great. If I am forced to stay with them is this what I have to expect going forward?

I know I am just one customer in a company that has millions of users around the world. But when did we start treating our customers like this, I am not sure what other options I have and would like some suggestions. This is just wrong on all levels and I just can't sit back and accept that this is the norm.

"How to contact someone above a store manger?I’m not sure if this is the right place, but maybe someone here can help?
Basically i have been trying to contact the store manger for over 2 weeks over a billing issue (unauthorized charges) and every single time I call he is “in a meeting” and can’t come to the phone. At this point I have called 6+ times over 2 weeks, and he won’t talk to me. I have talked to an employee who was talking to him but they would not put me on the phone with him. I really don’t understand why, since I have sincerely made an effort to be polite and not get impatient. Anyways. Does anyone know how I can contact a district manager, or somebody above a store manager? I just need to talk to someone who can help me resolve this issue since the general employees can’t, and the manager won’t. 

I would go into the store but it’s a weird situation, i live 3 hours away and apparently they’re the only store that can help me since that it where our plan was added on to.

"Tmobile lied to us...So when I switched over to Tmobile I was told by the saleswoman that the Galaxy S9 and S9+ both supported 5G. Now, I personally don't give a shit. LTE is perfectly fine for me. And yes I should have done my own research. But I went in set to buy the phone anyway so it really didn't influence me at all.

What i don't like is that when I went over to look at the S9+ and my mom went over to the S9 the saleswoman made a point to let us know that they were 5G compatible and that Tmobile would be rolling out 5G soon. Now I'm over here waiting for some technology I was told I have that it turns out I do not.

"T-Mobile ONE Video Tethering- Faster than 600 kbps?I'm temporarily using the 600 kbps T-Mobile ONE tethering as my primary internet. I'm on a OnePlus 6T (unlocked version, not purchased from T-Mobile). When I surf the web or download a large file, it's consistent with the 600 kbps speed, as are speed tests. However, YouTube streams at 480p and sometimes at 720p with almost no buffering. Meanwhile, a video on a random non-video focused site only gets 240p/360p. based on this behavior and looking at my tethering/non-tethering usage in the app, I think what's happening is my YouTube streaming is not getting tagged as tethering and is streaming at the higher 1.5 mbps rate.

Easy question. Does the T-Mobile Family Plan require that the people on the plan actually be related, or can I hop in with a group of friends?

"Free Netflix plus Free Fios Netflix questionAnyone else deal with this yet?  

We have T mobile in NYC. Service is A+  

Our One plan gets us free Netflix.  

Now a  weird promotion by Verizon Fios (home internet) allows us 6 free Months of Netflix as well. 

The person told me we'd receive an e mail about the promotion. We are to log in to our Netflix account and a credit would be applied for the 6 months. 

Now T mobile is footing the bill currently. Does anyone know what happens? Or should I make another account to receive the credit and pause the Account?

"Can someone take their phone number from my account to a new provider without changing my plan?I currently have 5 lines on the ONE plan, and someone on my plan would like to move to a different carrier. I'd like to keep the five lines, but not lose my current pricing. Is this possible?",1
"Did T-mobile get rid of the $30 5Gb/100 min prepaid plan?I had the $30 5GB/100 min a month plan for a few years. I know they don't like to sell that plan, and they wouldn't advertise it, and you'd have to know the right place on the website to sign up for it.

For various reasons, I didn't need this phone plan for a while and I let my account go unpaid for a few months, pausing the prepaid subscription.

But now that I want to reactivate my account, I log into the webpage and I seem to have been switched to some sort of $3/mo pay as you go plan. And as far as I can tell, when I try to switch plans, the $30 5GB/100 plan isn't available.

FCC Spectrum Auction Tops $1 Billion,1
"iPhones- Wifi Calling Not Working at HomeMy household has 3 T-Mobile iPhone lines on our postpaid account. We also have a Prepaid T-Mobile line on an unlocked Sprint iPhone 5S.

Here is the problem. **None of our postpaid iPhones will register on T-Mobile Wifi calling in the house.**  Our prepaid, unlocked, formerly Sprint iPhone 5S works on Wifi calling on the same Wifi network just fine!  We also have a Verizon iPhone 6S that also registers, albeit intermittently.  Our ISP is Comcast/Xfinity. They say they don't do any blocking of T-Mobile or Wifi calling on their side. Our router is an Asus GT-AC5300 tri-band gaming router.

Here's the weird thing. Of all our phones, why is it only the **T-Mo Prepaid, formerly Sprint iPhone 5S** that is reliably working on Wi-fi calling? Of all the iPhones this is the one I'd \*least\* expect to work.

All the iPhones work reliably on Wi-fi calling in two specific places.  One of them is at my parent's house, and they have Charter/Spectrum. Their router is a slightly different model than mine but it is configured identically to my home router. It also works at one of the branch offices of my places of employment, however it doesn't work at our main office location. They have AT&T 100 Mbit fiber as their ISP and they say IPSEC outbound connections are not firewalled.

Of course being iPhones, the devices won't give error messages or tell you what the problem is, the old adage of it ""just works"" sadly doesn't seem to apply anymore.

Here is what I have tried so far.

1. All of the steps at [https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3255](https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3255)  Including the E911 settings as well.
2. All phones are running latest IOS 12.1.4 and carrier settings bundle 35.0.1
3. The Airplane Mode workaround. **If I enable Airplane Mode and then enable Wi-fi, ALL of the phones are able to register on Wifi calling and are able to make and receive calls through our Wi-fi network.**
4. Speed test.  We get 150 Mbps downstream / 10 Mbps upstream with all devices.
5. Checked router's NAT Passthrough settings.  IPSEC and SIP passthrough are Enabled. Checked all DNS server settings and they are set to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and 8.8.4.4.
6. Factory reset the router even though I think all the settings are correct.
7. Replaced router with another factory fresh router. No effect.
8. Power cycled cable modem, yada yada yada.
9. Reset network settings on all iPhones.
10. Factory reset one iPhone, still not registering.
11. I have had 3 trouble tickets opened in as many months and the only thing Network Engineering supposedly did was push out some OTA updates to the phones.
12. I chatted with T-Force and they are sending me a new SIM card to see if that helps. **UPDATE:** With the new SIM card installed, WiFi calling worked for like 5 minutes, but it is now back to the ""normal"" ""problematic"" behavior.

The reason I am so concerned about this is because we are getting lots of dropped calls in the house even though we live 3000 feet from the tower and have 4 ""full"" bars of signal strength.

~~I haven't tried reaching out to Apple,~~ as they believe their products are perfect and foolproof and nothing is EVER their fault.

Any other advice? Is there a way to retrieve or view the log files from the iPhones to see what is preventing them from registering Wi-fi calling?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

EDITS: Grammar, Clarification

**UPDATE:** SIM card swap worked for all of 5 minutes, but now I'm back to the drawing board. This evening I reached out to Apple phone support and spoke with a ""Senior Advisor."" He did remote into my phone and we went over every possible setting.  He did give me a differing narrative than that of multiple reps of T-Mobile Team of Experts and T-Force.  He quoted an internal document saying something to the tune of iOS changed T-Mobile's Wifi calling behavior at some point in later revisions of iOS 11.3 or 11.4.  So, it looks like Apple IS pointing the finger at T-Mobile as I expected. I am scheduled to get a followup call from the rep next week. It seems if this is true, the people down in the ranks of T-Mobile CS have not been informed of these changes to Wifi calling protocols.",1

"Any way to switch to Simple Choice plan or other plan similar in price to Select Choice? Wasted over 2 hours at Costco trying to get deal.Hi everyone, I was excited and bought a used iPhone 6 to trade in for the Costco deal where you get a $750 rebate opening a new line. After a long wait and then purchasing the phone at checkout and walking back to the kiosk and attempting to add the line and sign a bunch of paperwork, I found out that we were not able to add another line to my existing 5 line Select Choice plan.

I have been with T-mobile for over 10 years probably closer to 20 years but we switched around and stuff in the past but it has been 10 straight years on this account. I saw that the Simple Choice plans were similar in price to what I am currently paying $120/month before tax for 5 lines and 3GB data but no idea if I could get on that plan or a similar one ASAP so I can take advantage of this promotion before it expires the end of month. I was pretty excited with the phone box almost ready to go but nope last second said they could not add another line.

Actually just added everything up and I am actually paying $110/month for the plan + \~$29/month in taxes and fees.

"36 month credits - are you *stuck* with the phone?I picked up an Xr in October (just after release) with 36 monthly credits for my trade in.

In order for me to get the credits, am I allowed to change my phone before this is over, and continue getting the credits?

Here are a few points of concern:

1. I financed the phone (only because it's required for the 36 months of credits). In order to sell it (and then buy a new phone), I probably need to pay it off. Right? And this will end my credits presumably? That's a sizeable loss....

2. The reason this comes up is that I have the opportunity to get a family member's 10S, which is smaller and more portable. But if I get rid of my 10R, I'm concerned of the fallout from losing credits potentially.

For my wife’, it shows Data Pass: Free Data for Life and Plan: MI on Demand Only at $10 (but I don’t pay anything).  My wife wants an new iPad mini with a plan if it is cheap enough.  A few questions:
Does anyone know if moving the sim will keep the FDFL on the new iPad?  Seems like it should given it worked on my other line.

I see I can click change plan and see both an On Demand (current) and SCNA 2gb and both show $10 for the price.  Can I change to the SCNA 2gb@ $10 and still get the $10 credit so effectively getting 2 gb for free?  If not, will it just charge me the $10?  If I change, would I ever be able to get back to just FDFL.  I ultimately don’t really care about preserving FDFL as tethering is easy from her iPhone to an iPad and 200 mb doesn’t do much, but I do want to preserve the $10 credit and if I could get a cheap (or better yet free) 2gb per month, she would like it (although I don’t think 2gb per month is worth $10).  The bee’s knees would be if I could somehow give her the same 5gb for $10 per month that I have (that does not show as an option, just a SCNA 6 gb for $25, which I assume would be $15 after credit)

Anyway, just looking thoughts, experiences or suggestions before I call customer care or maybe I will just try switching to the 2gb and see what happens.",1

"Alcatel Linkzone Wireless Hotspot and Terrible Customer Service/Technical SupportI just got out of the army and am currently staying with a relative while I wait on the government to complete paperwork that will allow me to start my new job. My relative doesn't have wifi and Verizon (my primary cellular provider) has terrible service in the area. I went to AT&T and T-Mobile to compare prices on prepaid internet plans. The one thing I can attest to for T-Mobile is that their prices blew AT&Ts out of the water, however I very much regret going with T-Mobile at this point. Let me explain why in this post where I'll be providing constructive criticism based on my experience with T-Mobile so far.  


I purchased the Alcatel Linkzone wireless hotspot device with the $85 (22GB) monthly plan. For the entire first month I had no issue with the device or the internet speeds. I used all of the 22GB of data and bought a 7GB data pass for $50. Still everything is working great. When the next month rolled around and I was able to renew the 22GB monthly plan I did. This is where I started having issues. My internet speed drastically decreased. I started off by trying to do some troubleshooting by myself (restarting the device, checking device settings, and performing a factory reset). When none of this worked I decided to give T-Mobile Customer Service a call.

&#x200B;

Upon calling customer service I was transferred to technical support (I was transferred to the wrong place twice before they got it right but that wasn't too big a deal). Tech support told me that I was experiencing slow speeds due to a known issue in which purchasing and using all of the data on a data pass and then renewing a monthly plan would cause slow speeds because the system still thinks you are using the data pass and not the monthly plan. 

Here is my first piece of constructive criticism: Why would you not warn customers purchasing a data pass or monthly plan that there is a known issue that would cause the internet speeds to be slow? I'm spending my hard earned money to not only enjoy internet but also to deal with professional matters that needed to get done before I started my job (and due to this, starting my job was greatly delayed).

&#x200B;

I was told by the technical support that they aren't able to fix the issue and would have to submit a ticket in order for the data pass to be removed. I'm not even going to get started on how outdated the T-Mobile website is (and I've heard from T-Mobile employees that the systems they have to work with are even worse), but why would you not allow your technical support department to make simple changes to user accounts like this? Anyways, I was told it would be 24h - 72h before the issue would be resolved. I told them that I really needed the internet that day and asked if there was anything that could be done. I was transferred again (I'm not sure what department I was transferred to) and spoke to an employee that told me he could fix the issue. After sitting on the phone with him for about 15 minutes he said he had removed the data pass and the internet should be getting high speeds within the next 2 hours. He told me he would continue to monitor the account and call me back in an hour. After an hour I was still experience slow speeds and I didn't receive the promised call. I waited another hour and still nothing. At this point it was late so I went to sleep. In the morning I checked my account and saw that the data pass was still there and the internet was still extremely slow.

&#x200B;

I called customer service again and asked for tech support. I was transferred and then explained what had happened. The employee apologized and told me she would file a ticket (with the same 24h -72h time frame). I told her that I needed the internet today and asked if anything could be done and she explained that she was not able to do anything except submit the ticket at an elevated priority. I was told I would be compensated for my troubles. I purchased a data pass with Verizon for $35 since I was told I would be compensated.

&#x200B;

Now I played the waiting game, using my iPhone as a wireless hotspot until the issue was fixed. One day passes, still slow speed. Two days. Three days. A week. I decided it was time to call back and see what the problem was. Upon calling back I was transferred to tech support and explained the issue. I was told by the employee that she was very sorry for my experience and she would try to make it better. She told me she would submit another ticket at the highest priority and it could take as long as a week for the issue to be fixed and that was all she could do. WHAT??!! We're back to square 1.

&#x200B;

This is where things get really frustrating. I had an issue with my Verizon service and called Verizon customer service. The employee was great and really helped me troubleshoot through the issue. She fixed things on her end and the issue was resolved in less than 20 minutes. After experiencing such great customer service from Verizon I called T-Mobile back very frustrated that they couldn't offer customer service even half as good. I asked for technical  support and then asked to speak to a supervisor. I explained my experience and the supervisor sounded shocked. He asked for the device's number so he could look up info on the account. When he had the account pulled up he told me NOT A SINGLE TICKET HAD BEEN SUBMITTED. ??? I had been straight up lied to by multiple T-Mobile employees and hadn't been getting service that I paid for over a week ago. Completely unacceptable. The supervisor said he would submit the ticket himself to make sure that it was done correctly and it would be 24h -72h. I stayed on the line until he said the ticket was completely submitted. 

&#x200B;

Come 3 days later I got a SMS message saying that the data pass was expired. I tested the device and the internet was still extremely slow. I called tech support and was told that it should be working at midnight when the system refreshes. So after all of that instead of T-Mobile actually handling the issue instead I just waited for the month long data pass to expire. I can't even explain how baffled I am that I could receive this kind of service from a company that is so successful. 

&#x200B;

So here is my constructive criticism for T-Mobile

1. If there is a known issue that will affect a customer's service, make sure that they know about this issue BEFORE they purchase the service
2. Update the outdated website and the outdated system the employees use
3. Give the Tech Support Department more power over accounts. How can they fix anything if they don't have access to tools that will let them fix the issue
4. Properly train employees on how to submit tickets for problem like this
5. Ensure that employees know that it's not okay to lie to customers

After this experience I don't think I'll ever be using T-Mobile again. Verizon has been infinitely better to me.",1
"Trying to make sense of this iPhone XR On Us promo going on right now. Just switched from Verizon.So today my family and I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile. We didn’t have time to finish everything today so we’re going back on Sunday to trade in a 6s Plus for the iPhone XR On Us promo.

From how the guy explained it today was that we’d have to pay a down payment on the iPhone XR. The entirety of it seemed super confusing to both my dad and me. 

How is it “On Us” if we’re trading in a phone AND paying something like 150 or 200 bucks on a down payment. They advertise it as a free phone but from my understanding it’s not. I could understand the trading of the phone in, but then a down payment also? 

What am I missing? Does the billing somehow in the end up working out?

"Questions about switching family plan from Verizon to T-Mobile [CA]My family of three is currently thinking about switching to T-Mobile because it's cheaper and supposedly better reception than the last time we had it. 

We have 2 paid off phones, a Samsung Galaxy S8 and S7E, and a Note 8 with $420 left.

1) The plan is to get two of the new S10's for the S8/S7E, but is it possible to use the Verizon Note 8 on the TM network? I'm assuming it is possible because the #Getoutofthered promotion states ""Switch and keep your eligible device. We’ll pay for it."", but I just want to make sure.

2) How does the promotion work? It says TM will provide a virtual card after 2 weeks, so we keep the Verizon plan for up to two weeks while using TM?

2) Would we be able to keep our phone numbers? We've had the same numbers for over a decade so it would be a huge hassle if we could not keep them. 

3) Do all three members have to be present? We all have very different schedules so it would be almost impossible for us three to go together. I (paid off S8) and my mother (paid off S7E) would be able to go in together, but my dad (not-paid off Note 8) would not be able to go in with us. ",1

"Server Error code 3 while trying to unlock OnePlus 6THey,

Let me preface this with an I'm incredibly annoyed right now. I waited 2 1/2+ hours waiting for a support member to answer my message. When they did, they apologized and said they can't help me. Letting me know that I should bring my phone to my nearest T-Mobile store to let them process the unlock. Yes, because it is in the hands of an in-store consultant, the unlock will now magically work.

Anyway, now for the real question.

While attempting to unlock my OnePlus 6T, no matter the circumstance, it will give me spit out error code 3. When I mean any circumstance, I mean; after factory resetting my phone 3 times, trying it on 3 different wireless networks, trying it using cellular multiple times, after clearing app data including cache.

Nothing has worked.

I'm certain that my device is eligible for the unlock, it has been payed of in it's entirety, and has been on the network since last December.

I'm completely clueless on what to do now. 

Any help would be *greatly* appreciated.

Thanks,

"The Coolpad Snap flip phone experienceGrabbed the phone just for fun. I actually wish it was on KaiOS like the Alcatel is (or better yet Kai OS 2.5 but that's wishful thinking...). I have no idea what this is on but the biggest issue I'm having is that I can't sync to my Google account to grab my contacts. Only two options, import .vcf or import from sim. Blah. (Nokia 3310 3g was able to import via Bluetooth but I can't seem to even do that.)

Otherwise, has WiFi calling, hd voice and hotspot stuff.

Not bad for what it is. Call quality sounds good, haven't been in a noisy area yet to test those conditions out.

\[Edit: Ooo. I got the contacts thing figured out. Bluetooth sharing, duh!\]

\[Edit 2: Trying to dial a number can be confusing. It's very laggy, you can start punching in numbers and not see anything. Then it goes to a screen that makes absolutely no sense. ""Dial Number / no contacts"" before it shifts to the Calling screen.\]

\[Edit 3: **Don't get this phone unless you really want an LTE B71 unit for calls and text only.** The OS is really NOT user friendly and lags way too much. There's a learning curve involved, not intuitive like with the Alcatel Go Flip which uses KaiOS 1.0. A non-tech savvy person who doesn't want to spend much and who doesn't need B71 might be happier with a smartphone like the Nokia 6.1 if you can catch it at the $180 price point on Amazon. (If you DO get it, soften the blow by getting the $25 gift card back through the T-Mobile Advantage program if your work/organization is on the list.)\]

I don't mind not getting LTE or anything but I'm concern about losing the cell reception in general as people won't be able reach me if there's any emergency.

I apologize for the long post and thanks for taking the time to read this. Please let me know if there's anybody experiencing the same problem and any advise or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.


TLDR: Phone not receiving reception at workplace indoor only, seeking for solution.

"Considering an eSIM trial run of T-Mobile service in SLC. WCGW?I'm in Salt Lake City, and I've been on Sprint for probably 12 years. I've been pretty happy with the service until fairly recently, when I started noticing some pretty serious gaps in coverage in areas where it should be (and has been) great. I thought maybe my phone was the problem, so I recently upgraded to an iPhone XS, but I'm still getting the same crappy coverage. 

So I'm thinking of signing up for T-Mobile's ""tourist"" plan through the iOS T-Mobile eSIM app ($30 for 1000 minutes and 2GB) to take the service for a test drive while keeping my Sprint plan simultaneously active. 

My question is, would doing this jeopardize my ability to take advantage of any new customer deals I might enjoy when signing up for T-Mobile One? Are there any other unapparent concerns I need to consider before signing up? 

If it matters, I'll be switching over four lines if/when I make the switch.",1

Weird. Why would this be? For the record: I don't care about having perfect coverage, crystal clear calls, or smooth data…that's why I'm getting the $3/mo plan, because I barely use my phone number (only FreedomPop and WhatsApp via wifi).

"An idea regarding thwarting neighbor spoofingFor a good few months now I've been trying to think of ways carriers might be able to thwart some of this shit and then I remembered a little thing called ANI II

""What's ANI II?"" 

Basically it's some supplemental data alongside ANI (a quasi-authoritative caller ID passed between switches in the PSTN, primarily for billing purposes) that tells the network what type of phone the calling party is using. More specifically it's a 2 digit integer. 00 represents a POTS line, IIRC, 61, 62, and 63 represent cellular and PCS, there's some other numbers in their for jail phones and payphones. Unfortunately for now, ANI and ANI II data can only be seen if you have a toll free number. I've actually bought an 800 specifically to get that data, it's pretty cool

""That's pretty cool. But how the hell could knowing the type of phone help?""

Well, think about it really. Most people have cell phones moreso than fixed line POTS and VOIP these days, so it's not unreasonable to think most people will be receiving bullshit calls on their cell phones. This means that the spoofers (unless you've ported your number or something) will likely be spoofing a number that's assigned to a cellular exchange. This is where ANI II could come in. When you spoof a call from a VOIP line, which is by far the easiest way to do this shit, the ANI II ends up being 00, a landline. A cellular number, presenting with ANI II that's completely inconsistent with the kind of carrier the number's associated with. If the FCC would permit it, this is an example of a basic heuristic that could possibly curb some of the neighbor spoofing shit",1

"Is there any way to get a second phone number on my phone **with** a name for outgoing calls?I have a small business that has it's own phone number, through Google Voice.

I understand that DIGITS somehow allows multiple phone numbers, but I've hear horror stories about phone numbers getting all screwed up in the process of porting and I absolutely can't afford for that to happen.

Any suggestions?

Are there any phones that can handle 2 sims and 2 different phone numbers?

"Advanced Messaging and the OnePlus 6TApparently Tmobile rolled out Advanced Messaging to my OnePlus 6T on March 13th.  That's the day that I stopped receiving messages from several people.

Not sure who to blame here, but took several weeks to figure out and there's no guarantee that my incoming messages will not stop again (it's not like someone calls you everytime they send a text).  On the OnePlus 6T, there are no user configurable settings and the user cannot 'disable' or opt out of Advanced Messaging.

I'm using the Google Messages App which is not compatible with Tmobile Advanced Messages.  Tmobile detects that my phone was upgraded and starts sending texts from other Tmobile Advanced Messages users to the stock OnePlus Messagse app.  Since I'm using the Google Messages App, there are no notifications or any indication that I'm missing messages from certain people.  Outgoing messages are sent just fine.

"Sad to see this provider lose its roots T-Mobile was genuinely a premier customer service provider five years ago.  I gave them a chance and moved my family account from Verizon and transitioned all my phones at the time.  We've spent on average at least $300/month since then.

This was not a popular move at the time as my teenagers disparaged me every time they went out of coverage (which was quite frequent at the time).   Still - they had access to (relatively) unlimited data and some other features which softened the blow.

I won't use Reddit to engage in a customer support issue but suffice it to say this is not the T-Mobile I grew to know and respect over the last five years.   I am in the process of negotiating a new contract with a different provider and it pains me to have to do this.   I have some respect for John L and the team, though that's diminishing.  I can only hope for a re-awakening because otherwise, their business is back to a basic commodity provider.   I had hoped for more.

"Galaxy S10+ Slow 4GLTE Data?I got the Galaxy S10 Plus on March 11th and swapped my old sim card from my old S7 Edge into it. Everything seemed fine until I went to a nearby restaurant and began using my 4G LTE data. I could not load websites with images and other slow connection issues, mind that I had full or 4 bars. I did a speed test and noticed I was only pulling 0.50-1 mbps. I asked my brother to borrow his phone, a Galaxy S9, and tested it. He was getting 20 mbps. Went back home and did another test with wifi off to see what I was getting there. Still the same.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind this area was totally fine with my S7 edge speeds before.

&#x200B;

I decided to use the Tmobile app and text support. We did the basic things like resetting the network settings and trying other sim cards. Even activated the new one that came with the phone. Still issues. I went to the other side of the island I live on near the Tmobile store. I noticed I started pulling up to 111mbps there but still in my town, I only get terrible speeds. Called customer support and explained everything and she said she would contact the local maintenance crews out here and see whats up with them or anything. She said she would give me a call back 3 days after but nothing, 6 days now and I called customer care again and got a new tech person and told him everything and gave him the other ticket number. Apparently she closed the ticket and wrote it off as a device issue. The new guy had me open up some diagnostic screen by typing in some numbers on the keypad and checked my phone status etc. told him how in other areas I get the really high speed LTE data but only in my home town area its slow. He told me it couldn't be a device issue if I can get really high data speeds in one area but in another get slow. Told me something like it is unstable on the network and keeps changing frequencies or something..

&#x200B;

I really hope it is not my phone because it's a pain in the butt to have to personalize it and everything again. So many accounts and just took so long. If it is of course I will do it because I can't be having these dreadful speeds but damn.. some luck I have if it turns to be the phone and not the network in my area...

"Victim of sim swap and phone purchaseA couple months ago, I received a text saying my sim was swapped in my phone. I lost all cellular activity right after. I had contacted tmobile about the issue and they were able to change it back immediately after. I got a new sim the next day for a precaution. I didn’t notice anything off or purchased at that time. 

Last month, I started noticing a finance charge on a new iPhone xr. My mother has a line on our account and I assumed it was hers. She initially bought an iPhone xr but returned it for an xs at Apple, and paid cash in full for the xs. Figured tmobile was incorrectly charging us the xr even after we returned it. After a long back and forth with tmobile about us already having returned the phone, they finally figured out that the return was unrelated and it was a fraudulent purchase. Someone in New York purchased an iPhone xr under an upgrade, and has me financing the phone. I’m in California. The purchase was made on the same day my sim was swapped. 

This is ridiculous how someone was able to walk right into a store and buy a phone under my account. Either the employee is in it, or their security measures are non existent. 

Hoping this gets resolved soon, and I need to place a credit freeze in the meantime. I also had two denied credit card applications around the same time sent to my old address at my parents house. ",1

I don't really mess with Apple products so I wanted to make sure this would work with no problems.

"What isn't compatible with Hookup (20% off VL's)Hi. I'm having billing issues, complicated issues that have been happening for about a year. I'm currently in talks with the executive response team and despite their own admission that my bill should be as I say, they can't fix it. I know from chatting with others that it is *possible* to get deals like Hookup added even if you don't qualify, *if* it's justified. From a technical standpoint, it can be done. I feel I have enough leverage with my unique set of issues that polite and persistent insistence will get me the discount. But I'd like to know if anything on my bill is incompatible. 

I'm on T-Mobile ONE Taxes Included, 4/$150. ($10 off for a free line I had before on ONE TE)

I've heard before that the T-Mobile ONE TI 4/$130 is incompatible with Hookup, though others here denied that. 

I also have:

•This one's on us (free line just 'cuz)

•Valentines BOGO

•Add 2 lines for 50% off each (May-June 2017)

•Kickback

•One+ PROMO (x6 lines)

•Netflix on US

•BETATHANKS free DIGITS (x4 lines)

•Free DIGITS T&T w/ $5 One+

•SyncUP Drive Basic (not a promo, but is grandfathered)

And for device promos:

•LG Superphone BOGO (twice, 4 phones total)

•OnePlus 6T $300 off w/ trade in launch deal

P.S: If they are totally unwilling to budge, and refuse the hookup deal, my backup plan it to ask for more free DIGITS lines. I think that's also possible. Can anyone confirm if this is a feasible back-up plan? I'd try for doubling what I already have. 3 more T&T lines and 2 Paired DIGITS lines. That'd be $50 in savings, similar to what I'd save with Hookup, but with the bonus to T-Mobile that I'd get $50 more for the same price I pay now, not $50 off that price for the same stuff I get now. I'd rather save the money than get more free stuff, but I'd take it over no deal.

Huge thanks to those who actually read through all this! Thank you to anyone with any info! 

EDIT: To clarify, my bill is currently $25 more than it should be due to the half off two lines promotion not working with the lines it's supposed to be on, despite everyone I talk to agreeing that it should be compatible. Additionally, they are trying to switch me from my $5 SyncUP DRIVE plan to the $15 plan for two lines. In total, it would be $45 extra. And yes, the $15 plan is $15 for me, not $10, because autopay maxes out at 8 per account, and the SyncUP DRIVEs are lines 9 and 10.

I've been saving one of my November, 2016 Simple Choice free lines for my daughter, and she's now at the age where we want to keep tabs, but not hand over a cellphone just yet.

We found a 4G kid's watch that runs on the T-Mobile network: TickTalk 3

It comes with a RedPocket sim, but we just popped in our free line sim, and it's working fine! Has a built-in firewall, so only Mom, Dad and others we place in the contacts can call the watch, and my kid can call back. Won't allow telemarketers, line spoofers, etc. through!

We can text, facetime, see where she is at any second. It's waterproof (although they say you shouldn't swim or anything with it... so more like water RESISTANT, I guess), and is getting great 4G wherever we've gone so far... (have had it since the beginning of the month.) Can also be used worldwide.

Trying real hard to not make this sound like a commercial (nope, not getting paid to post this, and yep, I had to buy the watch myself.)

If you have any questions, I'll do my best to try and answer them. If you want to use the Red Pocket sim/plan instead (runs on the T-Mo network), I think they have a $10/month one that's set up to work with the TickTalk 3... you HAVE to use a plan that's a real phone plan w/voice/data/texts... a wearable plan won't work with the TickTalk 3.

"Experience adding a line, swapping SIM cards, and keeping promosSo, I just managed to secure a T-Mobile S10+ at the Costco in Syracuse. My plan was to buy the S10+, add it as a new line to take advantage of the $390 prepaid Mastercard, and then swap this SIM into an Iphone 6 that my daughter uses, and swap the SIM from my old S8 into the S10.

In the end... I satisfy all of the criteria (I bought the new S10+ and activated a new line of service), so I figured I'm good to go.

The sales guy (who has been doing this for 10 years, so I'm guessing he knows what he's doing) suggested that I not do this until the rebate card is approved. That wouldn't work for me, as I need to add a line for my daughter, and she's not getting the S10+. He called his boss, who said that as long as the new SIM is activated in the new S10, and we can make a test call/text with it, that we should be good. It will effectively activate the new SIM with the new phone in T-Mobile's system, and all rebates should get approved. Makes sense to me.

I have not made, nor do I plan on making, any line changes (dropping lines, etc). I can't see why this would get rejected, but I'd like to harness the power of REDDIT EXPERIENCE for some feedback.

"S10 did not come with a screen protector nor a case?So I got my s10 on Sunday of last week, and I just found out that the s10 comes with a screen protector. I remember asking the guy for a screen protector there (not because i knew it had to come, but because I just want protection) and the guy said ""Yes, but it'll be $30."" I'm like 15, so I don't pay for my phone. I don't know if my dad payed the bill or not, and he said he doesn't remember because the guy had his card the whole time.

"Anyone's s10 still show pre-order status with a ship date of 3/6-3/8?So, I pre-ordered two galaxy s10 on 2/21, one in prism white the other in pink. My pink one shipped on 3/6 and we've received it. However the prism white phone never shipped. I called yesterday and the gentleman on the phone was very nice, but he didn't know what was up with my order. I don't particularly care if it's backordered or the ship date what was concerning me is the status was just saying pre-ordered with a ship day of 3/6 to 3/8.

"10GB SC vs. 10GB SC (SCFMUTT10 vs. NAFUTT4) & Unlimited & Gov't DiscountOK.... here's what I've found out. If you have the 15% gov't discount, and were on the Simple Choice 10GB plan w/ a SOC code of SCFMUTT10, the 15% discount worked. Comes to $102 + tax for the 10GB per line & includes data stash.

But.... if you wanted to partake in the permanent bump up to the Unlimited data, the SCFMUTT10 doesn't allow for that. You need a plan change to another Simple Choice 10GB plan with a SOC code of NAFUTT4. Doing so, either the T-Mo rep can move you to the Unlimited, or you can go in to each of your voice lines and make the switch to Unlimited manually. The bad news... the 15% gov't discount doesn't work with NAFUTT4..... so it will be $120 + tax for the Unlimited.

Both examples above come with 4 lines included.

The OVERALL good news is that the Simple Choice free lines all seem to be surviving the SC to SC plan change, so no worries there.

Again, this is only for the SCFMUTT10 vs. NAFUTT4. Other plans/SOC codes/flavors of Simple Choice may vary.",1

"Just had a very rude experience at a Tmobile store...So to start...a few weeks ago I walked into one of my local Tmobile stores to try out the S10/e/+ and OP6T. I enjoyed using all 4 phones. On the 6T I heard that the fingerprint reader was sometimes unreliable. So I registered my thumb print on the store model and it worked flawlessly. I didn't get anything that day and just walked out after a few minutes.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today where I went into the same store and one of the reps there whisked me away to the area where the 6T was (I was originally looking at the Samsungs again) The rep remembered me and was pissed that I registered my thumb print because that was the phone they use for music streaming through bluetooth. He said they tried time and time again to unlock the phone via thumbprint but couldn't do it because mine was the only one registered. Funny thing is that music was indeed playing from the store, so not sure why he kept harping on the inability to play music.

&#x200B;

He also insisted that I had to have created an unlock pattern as a backup way to unlock the phone. First off I NEVER EVER use patterns. I've always used a 4 digit pin. Even if I had to create a pattern I would have just done anything and never remembered it. The rep insisted that I must know the pattern and he kept egging me on to unlock it. I couldn't help and told him that he could ask me the question over and over again but I won't know the pattern. He remained pissed and just said ""ok whatever"" and walked away. I then walked out of the store. I wasn't planning on getting a new phone today but overall I was treated with disrespect and rudeness. It might not sound like much but the guy was really rude and stern with me. If and when I do get a new phone I certainly won't go to that store. They lost me as a customer.

&#x200B;

Ok now I ask the rest of this sub reddit and Tmob employees...can they really not unlock a demo / store model phone? If so couldn't you contact One Plus to get another demo phone in the store? I understand that I made a mistake by not deleting my thumbprint and apparently making the phone unusable for others, but I didn't do it on purpose and would think that for a demo phone they have a way of getting around that.

&#x200B;

Is there somewhere or someone I can tell this story to? I want to make it clear that I don't want the rep fired. I don't even know his name but perhaps some coaching or additional training? Gotta admit that was the worst retail experience I've had at Tmob and the worst retail experience anywhere in quite some time. I don't have Twitter but maybe there is someone I can call or email?

"iPhone XS Max and Dual Sim eSIM data problemsI have an iPhone XS Max (A2101) purchased in Europe. I am using a European carrier's physical SIM card and a TMobile prepaid eSIM which I use for voice and data. Unfortunately, when the physical SIM card is active, the data flow to the TMobile eSIM is terrible. It's laggy, choppy, and I am unable to hold Google Hangout meetings or use Facetime for audio or video conversations because it cuts in and out repeatedly. It's also laggy as hell for Brawl Stars. Any sort of application that requires a constant flow of data will suffer. I've tried it in three metropolitan cities across the US (NY, Dallas, and SF).

&#x200B;

Once I eject the physical SIM or disable it (by not entering the physical SIM's PIN, for example), the TMobile eSIM works perfectly. Originally I didn't suspect it was a hardware problem at first so I had TMobile reprovision my eSIM twice. Therefore, I am now on my 3rd eSIM but the problem is still there.

"TMobipe Wont/Can't Unlock PhoneI bought a TMobile locked iPhone (that she got from the T-Mobile store) off of Craigslist recently. I talked to the lady some before we met up and she agreed to meet at the TMobile store and have them unlock it before selling it to me. We're at the store and the lady pays off her last bills on the phone and one of the employees says that were all set and that I should receive two emails, one in 24 hours confirming that the phone will be unlocked and another in 48 hours with the code to unlock it. The lady gives me the phone and we both head home

Sounds good

I wait a day and a a few hours and I get an email from TMobile. The email basically says that the phone can't be unlocked because ""the device is not in use with the corresponding phone number."" I call up the T-Mobile store we met at and they said it's not really something they can deal with and to have the account owner to contact there customer service. At this point I was kind of scared because I was half expecting the lady that sold it to me to ghost and that she wouldn't help me fix any problems. I was wrong and she was super helpful. She called them and from what I understand they said it was a problem on apples part. She then contacts apple and they tell her there's no reason for it not to be unlocked and something along the lines of notifying T-Mobile to update their database. 

She then calls t mobile and they tell her to wait another day. The next day she calls them and they tell her they'll sort it all out and that the unlock code will be sent in 24 hours. Que to this evening where it's been well over a day. She calls them again and asks what's up and they say it can't be unlocked right now and to call back tomorrow.

I've been without a functional phone for about a week now and I'm getting a little irritated (old one won't charge). I'm not mad at anyone in particular in fact the employees at the T-Mobile store I was calling seemed to be pretty helpful, but I need this to get sorted out asap and by the looks of it, I get the feeling that T-Mobile is trying not to have this phone unlocked. The lady throughout this whole ordeal has been super helpful. She's been sending me screenshots of the support tickets and updating me about everything and even offered me a refund and to keep the phone if they can't get this sorted out, but I don't want any of that, I just want this fixed!

Sorry for the rant, I'm just not really sure what any steps are after this if they continue to not unlock it.

"Feel like T-Mobile gypped me out of $300 due to JOD and poorly written agreementsBack in February, when they announced the new Galaxy S10's, I decided I wanted to upgrade from my Galaxy S8 and I looked at the great deal that Samsung was offering and the OK deal that T-Mobile was offering and decided to go with T-Mobile so I wouldn't end up with another line of credit on my reports, etc.  I did the online upgrade and after answering the questions was told I'd get about $350 for my trade in.  Fast forward to just now  and as I was about to print my return label I noticed that it said the accepted value was $60.  I called T-Mobile and was told that I had one $24 payment left on my S8, so I couldn't get the trade in deal.  All I could get was a $60 bill credit for my old device.  I asked where in the offer did it say I had to have the phone completely paid off and she said that *it may not have been clearly stated anywhere I read*.  I'm so angry about this, I feel like I really need to send the S10 back, keep my S8, and switch to Verizon.  I've been with T-Mobile/VoiceStream/PowerTel since 1998, but now I think it may finally be time to part ways with magenta.    By the way, I thought about upgrading last year, but at the time it clearly stated that I had to have a least half of my phone paid off.  To make this happen, I sent in an additional payment and  a half to apply to my EIP.  I would have easily paid this last payment if I had seen anywhere that I needed it for the trade in.

Opt out or let it roll?I am currently on SC NA UTT+10GB each 4 Lines for $120 with 2 free data for life tablet plans (one the 200mb, the other is an up to a 5gb primary line data match for $10/month).  I don’t tether often nor have I really used the data stash.  I work from home so always had the data stash in case the internet went out ... but in 4 years have only used my phone a couple times for backup data.

Are there any catches that I am missing or should consider?  I am sure there is something in it for tmo or they wouldn’t be doing this.  I will still have 10 gb per line per month for tethering + 5gb from my tablet if I ever did need it, it says data lines are not impacted, so I can’t see a downside since I don’t need the data stash, but worried I am missing something.

Edit: Is the only negative the loss of the data stash (which really only impacts if you want to store data to tether)?",1

"tmobile support now gives tax advice! so cool!so I've been paying $50/month for the past 6-8 months for the $50 prepaid service. It's been $50 every month. $50 flat.

&#x200B;

So my payment was due yesterday, but for some reason my paypal card wouldnt let the payment go through. I decided to just skip the payment and wait till this morning to deal with it.

&#x200B;

So this morning I called paypal and fixed the issue, and when I went into my tmobile account to pay for it, the amount due was $54.90. Slightly more than the usual $50 i pay.

&#x200B;

So naturally I called support to ask why the sudden change in price. They told me it was because of taxes.

Then I asked ""are these new taxes? ""

&#x200B;

rep: ""no these are sales tax""

&#x200B;

me: ""ok, but why is it being charged this month but not the previous 8 months""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

me: ""excuse me?""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

me: ""do you understand english?""

&#x200B;

rep: ""yes sir I speak and understand english very well""

&#x200B;

me: ""ok then, so my original question was why are these taxes being charged this month but not the previous 8 months""

&#x200B;

rep: ""sir the only way you were paying $50 a month is if you were on the $45 plan""

&#x200B;

me: ""so are you calling me a liar?""

&#x200B;

rep: ""uh huh yes sir""

&#x200B;

me: ""ok can you transfer me to someone who speaks english?""

&#x200B;

rep: ""i am speaking english sir""

&#x200B;

me: ""i can see that, but you clearly do not understand my question""

&#x200B;

rep: ""sir just to let you know it is illegal to not pay your taxes in the united states""

&#x200B;

me: ""sir it is illegal to sell cocaine in the united states""

&#x200B;

rep: ""huh? could you repeat that""

&#x200B;

me: ""sir it is illegal to kill babies in the united states""

&#x200B;

rep: ""ok""

me: ""i thought we were just stating random laws that has nothing to do with my original question""

&#x200B;

rep: ""sir is there anything else I can help you with?""

&#x200B;

me: ""yes, answer my original question....""

&#x200B;

so I was frustrated at this point. So I opened up chat support and chat support explained to me why I was being charged that amount.

&#x200B;

basically if you change your plan for even just a day you will be charged taxes for the new plan, but wont be charged the taxes in the following months as long as you stay on that plan.

oh okay. That actually makes sense. Thank you.

"SC unlimited upgrade option (by 3/16) international roaming unlimited?So I'm in the minority among this group in that I use very little of my 6GB data since I stay on wifi most of the time. I also almost never tether. But I am planning an international vacation for a month where I think I would both use lots of data and potentially tether a lot. I don't think I'd ever use the 20GB data stash or tether stash I typically have every month, but it would be nice to have that extra data. So I don't know if there's really a benefit for me going to unlimited data and dropping my tethering down to 6gb only a month. 

I don't use tethering much or much of any of my 6gb of data that rolls overs to 20gb data stash frequently, but can't get over the fact that I'd lose the data stash tethering if I switched to unlimited. Seems to be the only down side. 20GB is a ton of free data for tethering. But if I don't use it, seems like there's no point in not switching to unlimited with the 6gb tethering data cap.

I'm assuming in the future having unlimited data will be a boon since more content will require higher data usage, but my question is does the unlimited data upgrade apply to international use as well? Or is it limited?",1

"T-Mobile Site Equipment GuideHere is the T-Mobile site equipment guide for the first half of 2019. Keep in mind, antennas can vary greatly, even within one's market. Not all sites use the same equipment. It is not uncommon to find ""legacy"" equipment on T-Mobile sites outside of major markets. Legacy equipment will not be posted in this guide, as I am attempting to make it a simple post for the most common equipment seen on T-Mobile's sites today.

&#x200B;

To start off, let's begin with Remote Radio Units/Heads (RRU/RRH). These are typically at the top of each site located behind panel antennas to reduce loss between the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and antenna. 

In Nokia markets, the following RRH models are used:

\- [NSN Flexi Radio](https://imgur.com/UmkNJHG)

\- [NSN AirScale](https://imgur.com/UAX9B1Y) (600/700 or 1900/2100MHz dual-band radio)

In Ericsson markets, the following RRH models are used:

\- [E/// RRUS 11](https://imgur.com/s5NGt9i)

\- [E/// RRUS 12](https://imgur.com/Rql0NYA)

\- [E/// RRUS 4478](https://imgur.com/mTlKhI9) (600/700MHz dual-band radio)

&#x200B;

Since 600MHz is the ""hot topic"" around r/tmobile nowadays, here are some setups I've seen while browsing Reddit:

\- [This is a setup using Ericsson AIR 21 and 32, with an APX panel for B12 and B71](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/atk74b/philly_600_mhz_installs_happening_now/) in Philadelphia. The AIR series antennas have integrated RRHs, hence, there not being radios for those panels. The APX panel is utilizing an Ericsson RRUS 4478 model and is dual-band capable, allowing B12 and B71 to be broadcasted from the same antenna (Credit to u/ERICLRICH). [Here's the APX antenna spec page](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/8xtg08/salt_lake_city_metro_market_b71_details/), posted by u/dmplus in Salt Lake City.

\- In Nokia markets, the setups use various different types of antennas, rather than just a couple different types. [Here is a setup in San Antonio, using a CommScope panel for B12 and B71](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/9nwjkz/new_antenna_spotted_in_san_antonio_tx_photo_inside/), and with a NSN AirScale RRH, which, similarly to Ericsson's RRUS 4478, is dual-band capable (Credit to u/besweeet). Other setups can include, but are not limited to, something like [this](https://imgur.com/QIMKqox) I saw in Tulsa, or like [this](https://imgur.com/4xeAKNc) in Oklahoma City, which are also made by CommScope.

\*Note: Ericsson RRUS 4478 and Nokia AirScale RRHs are NR capable.\*

&#x200B;

PCS/AWS (B2/B4) antenna setups in Ericsson markets typically do not vary within major metro areas. Most commonly, the setup will include AIR 21 for AWS/B4, and if the site has been upgraded, AIR 32 for PCS/B2, which can enable 4x4 MIMO. [Here's an example site in Salt Lake City](https://imgur.com/BglYHD1) (CommScope B12 panel in the middle), featuring AIR 21 and AIR 32. As I stated previously, RRHs are not visible, as they are already integrated within the antenna unit itself.

&#x200B;

700MHz antenna setups in Ericsson and Nokia markets typically use a CommScope panel that is relatively easy to identify. In the example picture from Salt Lake City, you can see a B12 panel squeezed in between both AIR panels.

&#x200B;

As for Nokia PCS/AWS setups, they can vary a lot. Therefore, I won't go into detail about it. Any questions or comments should be redirected to the discord server, per r/tmobile mods, in cooperation with new subreddit rules and guidelines.

&#x200B;

If there's anything I left out, feel free to comment and I will do the best I can at answering your questions.

They transferred me to technical support who said I should be talking to customer support who I asked not to transfer me who said let me check your account and without warning transferred me back to technical support. I hung up, called back and asked for a supervisor. Was put on hold forever and a day for a regular representative to come back to the phone. 

Anyway, is it possible that my numbers have been cloned? Do I have any malware? They are all iPhone X Max s if that makes any difference.

"T-Mobile asking for a deposit for new wireless service, even though I have great credit?Hey guys,

I'm trying to ditch AT&T because they are too expensive, and saw that T-Mobile is a pretty great deal. I have a family plan right now with 3 lines of unlimited data for $160 a month. T-Mobile is offering unlimited data with T-Mobile ONE, buy 2 lines get the 3rd line free. So 3 lines of unlimited data for $120 a month (with autopay).

I called up and said I was ready to make the switch. I told the super nice lady that I wanted to bring my own 3 devices, and just needed service and the SIM cards. She checked my IMEI numbers, said the phones were compatible, checked my numbers, and said they were portable, so she started taking down my information.

All was well until we got to the credit check, she said everything looks good, BUT I need to put down a line deposit for each line. $75 for the first line, $55 for the second line, and $25 for the third line. She said that I would get my full $155 deposit back after paying my bill on time for 12 months in a row. When I asked why the deposit was needed, she gave me a vague ""it happens sometimes with customers who have not so good credit"" answer. What doesn't make sense to me is that my credit is great. As of today, my score is 800 with Transunion, and 807 with Equifax.

I asked her if the credit report she was looking at had any helpful information, basically... ""what's wrong with my credit?"" She said she can't tell me because it won't share any information with her for security reasons. Don't get me wrong, $155 is not a lot of money, so it's not the end of the world. What turns me off is that one of the reasons I want to go to T-Mobile is because there are no contracts.

T-Mobile holding my $155 for one year kind of feels like... well, a contract? I asked her... ""what if it turns out I don't like the service? What if reception is bad at my house? Or at my job? What if I find a better deal somewhere else?"" She said I would simply lose the $155 if I left T-Mobile before the 12 months are up.

I don't understand it. I don't want to finance any devices, I'm not asking them for a $1,000 phone to go along with the service or anything, I just want service and 3 SIM cards. I literally called T-Mobile and said ""here, please take my money. I want to give you $120 a month, plus $75 for the SIM cards, plus I want to sign up for auto-pay, here is my debit card."" And... T-Mobile said ""sure, thanks, but first we need an extra $155 from you. Don't worry you'll get it back a year later."" So here I am now, looking at Sprint and other options. T-Mobile not taking my money lol.

My question is, has anyone else experienced this with T-Mobile when signing up for their service? Is there anything I can do or anyone I can talk to to circumvent the line deposits? It just doesn't make any sense. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",1
"Google voice not ringingI use Google voice on T-Mobile, and have for years. Fewer and fewer of my calls are getting through. As a temporary fix, I am forwarding my Google voice calls to Hangouts, but that seems a bit of a kludge. Aside from forwarding to Hangouts, I have not made any changes to my settings, and the switch to send all calls to voicemail is not checked. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. Discussion boards elsewhere say the move is to call T-Mobile, because T-Mobile has determined that Google voice forwarding is a form of spam, but their customer support is clueless when I have tried. I do not see this question previously answered here. Does anybody have any code words I can use with T-mo?",1

"Coverage in Socal and outing roadsAfter seven years T-Mobile still has zero coverage on sr38 ( Red Lands to Big Bear), sr18 (Irvine Lake to Mission Viejo) and sr74 (San Juan Capistrano to Lake Elsinore). Not to mention spotty coverage while traveling, even with 600 band. Are these spots ever going to get coverage? For the first time in years i'm considering going over to the dark side. Just a month ago I was stuck in traffic during a snow storm in CA-38 for 4 hours on the return trip with no service, moving a couple of feet every 30 minutes. Then on a recent trip to a friends house, I found out there is no service in Irvine close to 133 and portola highway. I bought a s9+ hoping for better coverage, if tmobile does not improve their coverage in these areas. I think that it would be time to switch. I understand not having coverage in areas away from highways and civilization. But, not having and not improving coverage in seven years in these trafficked routes is pushing me to switch.

"Phone possibly hacked? I'm not sure how this is possibleSo yesterday I got a phone call from t-mobile customer care saying I had bought an iphone and whether I had approved the purchase or not. He asked for the six digit pin that was texted to me. I was suspicious since he didn't sound very professional so I did not give him the number and assumed it was a phishing scam spoofing tmobile's customer care number. The odd thing is he knew the last 4 digits of my social. A few hours later I lose network signal, no voice or data. I use wifi to log into my tmobile account online to see if there was anything suspicious. The website says there is no tmobile account registered with this number. So I use my google number to wifi call tmobile customer service.

&#x200B;

I spent two hours trying to communicate with an Indian lady half way round the world over a phone signal that sounds like an AM radio. I could barely understand her and she would repeat things in a slow quiet voice that constantly broke up from the bad signal, sounding utterly confused and unsure of herself each time. I tried to get a manager but she said the manager wouldn't have any more information than she already did on her computer.

&#x200B;

Allegedly someone called them earlier today, pretending to be me, asking for my account information and balance, and subsequently cancelling my voice line while leaving the other lines on the family plan untouched. I asked them how was it so easy for them to cancel my line? She said I had to personally call them to make that decision from my smartphone, the one that's been with me all day, for that to happen. I asked if it was possible they spoofed my number and called them? She said no the system shows my number so it was from my phone line and my smartphone. I asked if I could get my number back. She said it had been ported to wholesale. I asked her what that was and how could it be ported out so quickly? She never answered most of my questions and I could barely make out what she was saying half the time, mainly because she would say it so meekly and uncertainly there was no emphasis on the words. I FINALLY got her to understand I needed a new line to replace the one cancelled under my family plan and told her I was getting a new SIM card from the Tmobile store instead of having her ship it. I almost got nothing out of the exchange, and I wasn't asking for much. Just some basic information. At least the initial ten minutes waiting on hold was rather quick, with plenty of voiceovers touting the quick and smart customer service tmobile provides with their team of ""experts"".

&#x200B;

"Tech Support ScamJust giving a heads up to others out there. I've gotten 6+ phone calls, 4 of those back to back after I rejected them because I didn't know the number and because I was working (It didn't show up as T-mobile, but it did show as one of their numbers after I googled it), but they continued to call. 

Anyways, the number 1-800-937-8997 calls and says They're from T-Mobile tech support they'd like to confirm that I had added 2 lines on new iPhones. They did have the right Name, which is worrisome, but after they put me on hold (after saying they need to talk to me right away lol) I hung up. They haven't called back since then. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. 

Apparently people were doing this as far back as 2014 spoofing the tech support number but it's been popping back up again.

"New rules and guidelines for the T-Mobile SubredditHi folks!

&#x200B;

The mod team has decided to change things up a bit in terms of pinned posts and content rules. The new changes are as follows:

&#x200B;

* **Speed tests** are now only allowed on **Mondays**. There will be a pinned post for them once a week every Monday. Speed tests posted on any other day (unless in the dedicated post) will be removed. This is mostly in line with the existing rule, except now the speed test megathread will only be pinned on Monday.

&#x200B;

* The **T-Mobile Tuesdays** megathread will only be pinned for that Tuesday, and the rest of the week it will not be. If there are any special Tuesday events it may stay pinned a bit longer.

&#x200B;

* **New Rule**: ""Who's on this tower?"" posts and pictures are no longer allowed in the subreddit. They're getting a bit spammy. We do however encourage them on the discord server (linked below). **EDIT**: We will be going with a “Tower Fridays” weekly megathread. Look for more info later this week!

&#x200B;

* We will also begin to pin useful or relevant posts throughout the week. If a particular post becomes really popular or has information that many people would find relevant, we will pin it.

&#x200B;

I would also like to take the time to remind everyone our guidelines regarding politically charged content in the sub. We have no rules against political posts or comments, at all, as long as they are relevant to T-Mobile. We do not censor or remove political comments regardless of their content, unless they violate the rules. If you post a comment and it is directly insulting someone or is entirely rude or hateful, it will be removed. Please know that this is not censorship of one political party or another. We want a healthy and thriving community with polite debate, not name-calling and hateful rhetoric. If you see comments, political or not, that violate the rules, please report them. DO NOT report comments just because you disagree with them.

&#x200B;

Please let us know in the comments below if you have any other suggestions or comments about these changes. Thanks!

If it were a network issue, the distortion would surely be happening when the call is made or received directly from the handset without Bluetooth being a factor. 

Better explanation: 
iPhone + Bluetooth + VoLTE = distortion.
iPhone + Bluetooth + WiFi calling = distortion.
iPhone - Bluetooth + VoLTE = no distortion.
iPhone - Bluetooth + WiFi calling = no distortion.
iPhone + Bluetooth - VoLTE = no distortion but dropped calls.

They said that they couldn’t do that in the store, but that Customer Care could do it. The system was down so I had to come back a second time. The woman was on the phone with Customer Care for a long time. Lot of back and forth and finally I got my phone back with the T-Mobile plan. I never saw her install a physical sim, but now I am in Europe and I open up the phone and there is a T-Mobile sim in the slot and no sign of esim. When I put a European Vodaphone sim in the slot, any sign of T-Mobile disappeared. I can’t believe this happened. I will reach out to T-Mobile but unless they can corrrect this remotely I will have to go buy another phone. My bad for not checking until now, but wtf. ",1

"Get 2 Lines Add a Third Free Questions: Amplified Sales vs CostcoTrying to learn more about activating this plan (currently with Verizon)

I have an iPhone 7 and 7 Plus that I’d like to trade in for iPhone XRs and an unlocked iPhone available to activate. 

1. My company has an Amplified Offer but they also offer retail plans as well through the Amplified 800#. They mentioned a $150 rebate per new line on T-Mobile One plans. 

Has anyone activated with the Amplified sales team on the 2 lines, 3rd free promotion? I’m trying to find out if all 3 lines would get $150 or if it’s just the 2 paid lines. 

2.  Another option is to go to Costco. 

How many iPhone $390 rebates are available if activating 3 lines? Is it just 1 or will lines 2 and 3 both qualify for the trade in/$390 rebate?

3. Or is there combination of the two that I can maximize these promotions ($150 activation & $390 iPhone rebates)?

"Switching to Xfinity Mobile, bye fam!Been with T-Mobile for about four years. It's been alright, but it's time I switch to something more reliable. I drive for Uber sometimes and the amount of dead spots with T-Mobile was super frustrating and caused me problems with trying to start/end trips. I got a cheap secondary phone on Xfinity Mobile 6 months ago, and so far so good. Last week I started using that phone for Uber and it's so much better. No dead spots! Woohoo! So I decided to switch my primary phone and so I have a Galaxy S10e on order from Xfinity Mobile.

I will definitely miss how fast T-Mobile's network is... according to Speedtest, it's like 10x faster almost everywhere... but I'd rather have mediocre speeds all the time than excellent speeds sometimes and absolutely no service sometimes.

I did appreciate how friendly T-Mobile support was - though sometimes it seems like they don't know what they are doing and the same problem requires multiple phone calls to resolve. Most recently, I purchased a hotspot which was completely useless from day one after the system kept thinking it was a SyncUP Drive so it didn't actually work. I'd contact support, they'd fix it, and a few days later it would stop working again. Oh well, I cancelled the line, got refunded for the last few months of service, and sold the hotspot to my friend (it worked with a Project Fi SIM, which is cool!).",1

"iPhone XS MAX Unlock QuestionHello all.

Today, I went to my local T-Mobile store to have my phone unlocked. I paid off my device in FULL and within a few hours I received an email from T-Mobile with some instructions I need to follow (after waiting 48 hours) to complete the unlock of my phone.

So, I am hoping someone can answer 2 questions for me as this is the VERY 1st time I ever went this route to get a device unlocked and I am VERY unfamiliar with this process.

1. Once the iPhone is unlocked, will i get another notification (email from T-Mobile) letting me know that the unlock is ready? (using the word ""ready"" for lack of a better word here)
2. A sentence in the email instructions from T-Mobile for unlocking my phone seems a bit extreme. It states ""When you have a backup, erase your iPhone. Then plug phone into iTunes and follow setup"". 

Is it really necessary to erase my phone to perform this unlock? It kinda doesn't make sense to me because I am still going to use my T-Mobile SIM. I don't have any other SIM cards to put into the phone (yet).

Does anyone have experience with this that may be able to share some wisdom? It would be greatly appreciated :) ",1

"T-Mobile eSim question. Activated but iPhone message?Hello everyone! 

So I just did the T-Mobile eSim postpaid trick and it worked, surprisingly.

So I went on the chat, and told the rep I want to update sim. Gave him the sim number right away and he said “If we're going to replace the current SIM card number that you have on the account. You might experience an interruption of the services. And if we will replace it once done and did not work. You will be needing to buy a new SIM card.” I said well you gotta risk it to get the biscuit and then he said okay sir no problem and he did it.

I went through the process after of adding that cellular plan and updating that link and it accepted it but got an iPhone message saying “Uncertified Plan. This plan is not certified so voice and data services may be affected” I clicked okay and proceeded as normal. It seems to be working as normal, but I’m wondering If anyone else got this issue and if you have experienced any adverse affect using T-Mobile eSim on postpaid!

"LG Stylo 3 Plus replacement for my sonSo my son has a phone only because it's free for life. He had a Nexus 5, it died so we got him there stylo 3 plus. He had a tablet but he now uses the phone more and we find now it takes decent pictures but not great and more importantly, the battery dies a lot quicker even when it is in his backpack all day, sometimes full to Dead in a few hours even when not using it.

Was thinking the Stylo 4 but thinking about improving his experience since he is using it more and any extra payments will be offset by turning my tablet cell line off. Kind of want to not go to an iPhone and don't want s10. But don't want the Moto or revel eithier.

Suggestions or recent purchases by others appreciated.

**UPDATE**
I did take my son to the store to look at phones.  Because of the fact I want him to have a good phone for us to go to the Kiss concert with for photos and waiting times, it would never make it by Wed if I ordered online, plus wanted him to have his input within reason.  He held and tested each, not much difference but width, and he liked the Stylo 4, but he didn't want comparable to what he had, so he got in between the V40 and One plus 6T on his own as I let him look at all the phones, except iPhones or S10's. He decided on the 6T and was all excited, then the guy told us they didn't have it and he has to call me when he does but it should be by Tuesday at the latest.

At this point, the only thing I can think of is that he is still using the old SIM card from his older Moto G3 that we cut to fit the nanoSIM slot while I was issued a new nanoSIM card. Any ideas?",1

"Need a new phone soon. Buy now or wait to see what may be needed for 5G in a few months?My LG G6 keeps randomy shutting down at 20-40% battery. When I try to turn it on it says the battery is completely out, but when I plug it in it says 40% within 2 minutes. Something is wrong with the battery sensor or something. The phone is paid off right now, so I figure I will just get a new one.

Mainly looking at the iPhone XR and the OnePlus 6T. I have never used Apple OS and only have Windows Machines, so I don't really know how the transition would go. My wife is all Apple and says she typically has some trouble when trying to use Windows machines to sync with the iPhone, compared to her Apple machines and the integration.

With 5G coming in the next few months I was wondering if I should just wait to see what comes through. I know it will be a little more expensive, and the selection will be low. Also waiting might mean most 4g phones will become cheaper.

Any advice? I'd like to keep payments low. 

Right now I can trade in my G6 for credits towards the Samsung S10e, but it doesn't really seem like an upgrade to the G6.

Edit: thanks for all the responses. I think I will keep the G6 for now and just be proactive about keeping it charged. I think it may be the cold temps and a messed up sensor. I'm going to try a reset first, then see what happens. I'd rather just save the $20+/month for now and see what happens.",1

"My Galaxy S10+ Preorder NightmareAs someone who uses an IPhone I was hyped and exited to finally switch to a new platform. Especially with the great amount of deals, good phone pre release reviews. If only I knew what's about to come.

**How it Began:**

On February 27th, I upgraded my phone through the T-Mobile (US) upgrade program + trade in, signed the EIP and was ecstatic that I'm getting my phone early March (it was somewhat between 7-10th). In 2 days I wanted to check on my order and what do I see? Nothing. It was quite difficult to explain to the Customer Representatives that I have the signed EIP on my hands but the order wasn't placed in the system, mind me saying that it more than 48 hours have passed since that moment.

**Customer Service Call Attempt #1:** Saturday, March 1. After about 15-20 minutes of talking to customer service rep I was told that I need to place another order, and cancel the last EIP if I'll be double charged. *""Thank you, but no.""* How can someone offer such a thing based on vague assumptions that it might or might not happen, and if it happens *YOU deal with it.*

**Customer Service Call Attempt #2:** Saturday or Sunday, March 1-2 (don't quite remember). After nearly an hour. I was told that everything is fine and I'll be getting my device, and the order will appear shortly. ""*Finally, some assurance that everything is fine.""* Thought I. So I decided to wait, a bit more, as was recommended by the customer service rep.

*\*Paranoia Intensifies.\* There are no signs of my order, estimations.*

**Customer Service Call Attempt #3:** Tuesday, March 5. Talking about the issue, nearly one hour. Problem escalated to the supervisor. Call is being dropped by the rep, no follow up call in 15 minutes.

**Customer Service Call Attempt #4:** Tuesday, February 5.  *\*15 minutes after the attempt #3\**. I realize that now I have to explain everything that we spoke about for the past hour to another customer service rep with no possible way to talk to the one before that. *Not giving up.* However this time it's significantly harder to explain what's the issue. Since the customer service rep refuses to believe me, and won't check the signed documents on my end. After about 1h 30min of talks with the supervisor, the issue was identified as some weird system error that processed my EIP and Signature, but didn't pop the order, and that it will 100% be cancelled, and we should place another order or I won't be getting anything. *""At least this time I know for sure that it would be a) done properly. b) I won't be double charged.""* \- Thought I.

However since the order was placed again on March 5th, the estimate shipping date now Is \*\*\*03/27/2019 - 04/02/2019... ""\*\*\**Ummm. April... What?"".* You can probably understand my frustration. From March 7-10 to the Beginning of April? Let's not forget, There's a special promotion from Samsung regarding 130$ Ear Buds that's for preorder only that can be redeemed by some time somewhere in April.. But I'll return to that.

**Customer Service Call Attempt #5:** Thursday, March 7. I'm asking politely to find a way to get my pre-order in an acceptable timeframe. Get Rejected. *<input sadness here>.*

**March 7th. Final Preorder Day.** I get a text message from T-Mobile that states:

*""Hello, Unfortunately, we could not ship your order as we run out of stock (including all other colors). Do not make a new order as our website seems to not be fully updated for all customers. A refund has been processed in case you have been charged, expect it in 3-4 days. Please do not hesitate to email us regarding any issue you have with our services, we will try to respond in less than 24 hours.""*

**Customer Service Call Attempt #6:** Thursday, March 7. They tell me to ignore the message, and I'll be updated on the progress by the end of the week. : /

As of now. My *""Would you recommend T-Mobile to a friend""* dropped from 8 to 1. I'm not sure after all the promises and kind words that I'll be even getting my phone. You might think for a big company like T-Mobile this whole thing would not be an issue... I was never so wrong. I'll make sure I'll finishing this story with hopefully a happy resolution.

**Update #1: March, 7th.** I was recommended to get in touch with a rep via Facebook. So I did. After reviewing everything, I was told that the order was not declined. Everything is tip top. and the rep will get in touch with me next week on Tuesday, to check upon me. *Let's just wait and see now.*

**Update #2: March, 11th.** Still no signs of the situation changing. Just spoke to another Rep, and a superior officer, both say ""You order is on **back order"" & ""we're sorry"".** Basically saying that they will ship the items as soon as they will be available and they can't do anything to speed up the process. Too bad the transition to Samsung is so unnecessary painful.

I've been in phone limbo for the past hour. I called their number and they've spun me around to dozen different departments. From pre-pay to post-pay. From post-pay to pre-pay. Pre-pay to order support. To technical support. To activations. They tell me a different reason each time from they can't lookup my order number to they can't handle returns. The first time I called they were activating my device and tried to charge me again for a second plan.

Finally I reached someone who said they can't make a shipping label because I'm on pre-pay, only accept returning in store. But I'm in VT which doesn't have any t-mobile stores.

"Simple Choice grandfathered $20 unlimited and the free unlimited upgradeI currently have a Simple Choice plan with 10 voice lines and 3 data lines. There are 8 voice lines with 4GB of high speed data each (one of which is a ""this one is on us"" line) and 2 voice lines with grandfathered $20 unlimited data with 5GB of tethering each. There are 2 data lines with 5GB high speed ""data match"" and 1 with just 2GB of high speed data. We have a 15% government discount on our account so we pay just over $230 including taxes for the account total each month.

We have not received the text regarding an upgrade of the 4GB lines to unlimited for free. Is this because of the 2 lines that have the old $20 unlimited? If so, can I simply remove the unlimited on those lines and bring them down to 4GB lines and have them all upgraded to unlimited? I'm pretty sure all the lines would then get 4GB of tethering. We would end up saving a decent amount while gaining unlimited on all the lines, with the only negative being that we would drop from 5GB of tethering data to 4GB for the 2 lines, correct?

I'm also going to cancel the 2GB data line since it gets very little usage at this point. If I could end up with 10 voice lines with unlimited high speed data and 4GB of tethering each along with 2 data lines with 5GB each all for under $190 a month, I'd be a happy camper.",1

I don't know what enterprise email is, but is there any difference between the two different 4gb plan, other than the enterprise email and $5 up charge?

Best Buy is offering $550 if I trade in the phone towards the S10 but I was told I'd need to unlock my S9 in order for BB to accept it, which I believe means I'd need to pay off the balance on the phone.

If I pay off the remaining $390, does my BOGO free credit disappear as well? My bill on T-Mobile's website says I have 23 monthly credits left. I wouldn't be cancelling my line/number either, I'd just buy an unlocked S10 from Best Buy and activate it through T-Mobile.

"Can I add a 9th voice line without losing my free lines?Perhaps someone can tell me whether my plan is set up to allow this? I had an issue a couple years ago when I added a 9th voice line, and lost my free lines.

I've been hesitant to add a 9th line since that debacle, but wanted to know if things have changed since.

Here's a picture of my lines from my bill, and a screenshot of what my account plan looks like from the website:

"Giving my S10+ a once-overI just received my s10+. I was giving it a once over just to make sure there are no scratches, etc on this new device. A few things I noticed. First, the screen protector is installed by Samsung, but it still has some dirt and scuffs on it out of the box. Second, on the sides where the metal frame is, apparently they have stuck some protective film all around. Finally and most interesting, I turned on my other phones flashlight and started looking at the screen in detail. Is it me or when you get toward the bottom you can actually see almost like a rectangular hole/cutout in the screen which looks to be exactly where the fingerprint reader is. It's crazy because just under normal light I can't see it, just when using the flashlight.

"Which to choose - 10GB w/Data Stash or Unlimited 4G w/SMH? 

>I was one of many who had their promo plans permanently changed last week courtesy of T-Mobile.  The 10GB High-Speed Data with Data Stash which T-Mobile was bumped to Unlimited Nationwide 4G Data + 10 GB SMH initially through 2/28/19. Now that it is permanent, I am reviewing the pros and cons of each option.  
I don't do a lot of tethering as I have another line with a hotspot device. Most of the users on our plan (kids in HS through college) are around wifi most of the day, but we do have one user whose only source of internet is her phone. I have kept her on the Unlimited option and she doesn't use the hotspot feature.  
When it comes to Binge On or Music Freedom or other features, are there other things to be aware of when choosing one option over the other?  Even though we don't use it too much, are there speed differences for tethering between the two options? Anything else to consider between the two choices?

"S10 pre-order helpI know this probably isnt the right place for this but I do not know what else to do. 

&#x200B;

My wife and I preordered S10+ on Feb 24. I guess they started running CCs last weekend, and my card got dinged with a fraud alert. I cleared it with my bank, and then did a chat with TMobile the next day to make sure it was reprocessed and everything was good. They assured me it was still estimated to ship 3/6-3/8. 

I still saw order processing, so I dug little deeper and it turns out that the whole order was cancelled. I called and had them confirm my card and make sure everything was ok. The agent didnt seem to speak the best english and didn't seem to see what i was asking about. I decided to get the twitter help involved and he said everything seemed good to go. Then he came back about 20 minutes later and said he did more digging and got a do not honor message for this order. 

&#x200B;

So now I apparently have to reorder. I can try my luck at the store Friday morning, but i have to pre-order to get the phone and i can't do that for an in-store pickup. Pre ordered phones now have an estimated shipping date of 3/27. This is kind of ridiculous. They couldn't move that date up for me.

"Switching from Verizon to T-MobileHello, I am switching from Verizon to T-Mobile using their Get out of the red promotion. I have a few questions that I have been getting mixed answers from the chat agents on T-Mobile. 

1. Will T-Mobile pay off both my lines? I have a Galaxy S9, and my other has an iPhone 8 Plus. Both of these phones are the same price, at $533.28 per phone. Which totals at $1,066.56 that we still owe. 

Reason I'm asking this is because, I heard that only $400 of the $650 go towards the phone. The other $250 goes towards Early Termination Fees (ETFs). 

Problem is, I dont have ETFs at Verizon. I just have to pay off the phones and I'm out. So, will the rest of the $250 be added to cover the phone?

2. When I switch to T-Mobile, am I required to have the T-Mobile ONE PLUS plan. How long do I need stay in that plan? After T-Mobile sends me the money to pay off the phones? 

3. Am I able to reduce the plan to T-Mobile One? I have no need for the Hotspot or do I travel, so I don't need the ONE PLUS plan. 

I hope you guys can answer these questions as I am really deciding whether or not to switch over. This promotion is very tempting to say the least and would result in a lower monthly plan. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and answer my questions. 

Edit: One more question. When is the time to switch? My next bill is on the 26th. Do I switch before that day to avoid any extra charges? Or how does that work?",1

"How to Lower Your Cable Bill and Get the Best Deals(Edit: If you’re DMing me for personal advice, just know that I’m doing this off the clock and there’s literally 20 dms per hour. I love helping you guys fight back but give me time to get to you.)

As a retention agent and milling around on these boards I always get asked every day how to reduce your cable bill.

It’s really easy. It doesn’t require threatening or arguing, yelling at a manager or retention agent either.

I read blogs about how to reduce your cable bill and I laugh because it’s misguided.

You ever wonder why you and your neighbor has the same service but different price? 

Let me tell you why.


Comcast’s deals are available because of a simple algorithm. It doesn’t care if you’ve been a customer for 1 year or 30.
It doesn’t care if you pay your bill on time or if you’re late and get shut off every month.

It simply wants to know what services you have and positions you to upgrade at better value or situationally if you are going to be another subscriber loss.

Simply put if you don’t have a service you can always upgrade at a lower cost.

Let’s take internet for instance. Say you had 100mbps at regular price, say $100. You’re thinking to yourself, “Fuck this my mom has 200 for $50 Comcast can ligma.”

Well if you were to upgrade to TV and Internet you could get 100 mbps and TV for $60 as an upgrade OR be a disconnect potential and get the same deal your mom has. 

Basically you get deals on plus-oneing.

It’s all in the system right from the start before you even get off of hold to talk to me.

Just ask for the retention offers for your particular package you already have if you’re not interested in upgrading. And once yo know what they are, hang up, call back and say someone in the store offered it to you. We’ll honor it.

Say you have TV and Internet and you see a new customer deal for TV and Internet right? Well you’re not eligible cause you have it already. Sucks to be you.

Well just disconnect TV and go internet only for a day, and the system will tell me you don’t have TV and you will be eligible for those TV and internet deals.

Pretty funny once you see it from this side.

And agents will say “Oh well if you disconnect you’re not eligible for x amount of days.

That’s true, you’re not supposed to be eligible. 

But if I have low sales for the month or I want to hit a mark for an incentive you’re going to get that deal from me. And as someone who is the top seller in my building, no boss ever said “you have too many sales, get in my office”

Someone is desperate to get a RGU (revenue generating unit) sale. The 60 day restriction is like getting a ticket for jaywalking. You ain’t getting one.

Let me give a storied example:

One day a buddy of mine in office took a TV disconnect cause he didn’t get a disconnect all day and called the guy out. Well he wasn’t bluffing. We laughed at the end of the call and I was telling him he was stupid for hardballing the guy. 

Buddy at work left at 4pm and the disconnect guy calls back, gets me and asked what to do with the cable boxes.

I asked why he disconnected and the dude said it’s just too expensive for me.

I told him well I’m sorry we were not flexible, how about TV and 200 mbps internet for $69 if we keep your business? He was ecstatic and I got a sale and all I had to do was reactivate his cable boxes he already had.

This man went from roughly $180/month to about $90 FOR THE SAME SERVICE HE HAD in about 4 hours. All because of the dumb sales system. NO CONTRACT EITHER.

"Netgear CM1000: Need help decoding logs, Xfinity has been unreliableEver since Comcast raised the equipment fee to $13, I decided to get my own equipment, the Netgear CM1000-1AZNAS and a Google Wifi. This was a few months ago. They might have been overkill considering I'm on the 60Mbps, but I figure Docsis 3.1 could be helpful eventually, since I work from home, and would love faster uploads.

&#x200B;

So for the past 2 weeks, sometimes my Internet some days is very slow, or not usable at all. A quick 1 minute unplug of the modem and or router usually did the trick, but today was pretty painful.

&#x200B;

I was trying to diagnose whether it was the router, or modem, and determined it was the modem (I plugged my TV straight into the modem, and sometimes, it would not work at all, or would be very slow (6Mbps instead of 60Mbps). The 6 sounds ok, but real world use was terrible.

&#x200B;

Eventually, for some reason, the Internet was starting to look good, so I tried to connect Google Wifi to my modem again, and I guess the modem lost connection, so Google recommended I unplug the router for 5 minutes instead of my usual 1, and that seemed to finally do the trick.

&#x200B;

So I have 2 questions

&#x200B;

1. What's the difference between unplugging for 1 minute vs 5? Does IP reset or something happen at 5, which could help more than 1 minute?
2. Do you see anything odd about my logs? Does it look more like Netgear causing performance, or Comcast side?

"Data usage question and concernsWe were just recently hit with the typical bill increases after our first year of a two year contract and opted in to dropping our DVR/HD TV services which also resulted in us swapping boxes in January. Since the box swaps and bill changes our data usage has been quite a bit more than normal and it makes absolutely no sense.

Our usage looks something like this:

Oct 2018 - 248 GB

Nov 2018 - 400 GB

Dec 2018 - 383 GB (We added a fire stick between Nov & Dec)

Onwards to 2019 where we had the box/DVR/HD programming changes:

Jan 2019 - 684 GB (probably 100GB+ of content downloads so not shocked here)

Feb 2019 - 528 GB (shortest month of the year?)

Mar 2019 - 517 GB

And the biggest shocker to me which prompted this post today is the fact that at the end of the ***first day of April I'm already at 33GB*** with about 4 games of League of Legends and maybe 4-5 hours of streaming last night.

We never use the box for streaming Netflix at the same time as the fire stick. It's always one or the other and never both. This is also not 4K streaming.

Is Comcast carrying over data from the previous month even though they are showing it as April 1 - April 30?

It's almost as if they saw one month of data usage that I already knew was going to be high and started following the trend.",0

"Comcast Does NOT Support DOCSIS 3.1 In Full - Request for Comments and Information.Hi guys! If you found this post because you're experiencing issues with your DOCSIS 3.1 device and the Xfinity network, I suggest you open a case with Netgear and confirm loss of block sync with them as an ISP issue, and call the escalation department at (215) 665-1700.

Specifically, the inability of the CMTS associated to the residential node you are connected through to support ""certified"" 3rd-party equipment from manufacturers such as Netgear at ""Gigabit"" speeds in a residential area on a residential Gigabit connection/service level. I do not believe they support this 3rd party equipment in the manner they advertise. I have an ongoing ticket with Netgear in which we are working to compile information for these issues. It's clear this service tier is being sold to customers without appropriate support for this type of service or device. Over a 30 day period, I have measured the upstream power levels from my modem to the CMTS I am connected to (a Cisco CMTS in my case) at 2 different times in the day which are considered peak Time of Use. Measurements include the correlation of increasing upstream transmit power from my modem to the CMTS, associated with a rapid increase in uncorrectable codewords and rapidly degrading SNR which is correlated with time over a 1 hour period - 30 minutes before and ending 30 minutes after the peak Time of Use for my area. The modem experiences rapidly increasing T3/T4 time outs during these periods of time. If the modem upstream power level begins to be too hot, the modem enters a state of intermittent connectivity with SNR below 30dB across all downstream channels and will not run faster than ~15Mb/ps. Eventually, the device completely loses connectivity and complete loss of block sync as it tries to reboot and range correctly. This results in an inability to range and lock any downstream channel with acceptable signal and resulting in the device completely losing connectivity. This has happened since I have started service with Comcast. No other cable ISP has this issue with this device. The device begins to work again, approximately a day after maintenance is over (24hrs+ after maintenance end). This is guaranteed to happen in my situation when Comcast performs maintenance in my area (scheduled or not). It also can happen during the peak time of use scenarios I described. To me this indicates a lack of capacity at the node servicing my area for this service tier, or further faults at the CMTS. Comcast does not seem to employ technicians on phone support who understand the terminology I am using in this post, making it impossible to get actual support, even when you request repeatedly to speak to the appropriate department. This is not acceptable. Comcast refuses to provide a technical resolution to the issue, and uses psychological tactics and manipulation (altering the context of the discussion to frame me in a certain way, attempting to accuse me of requesting unreasonable accommodation, doing anything and everything to get me off the phone, arguing with me in every way they can so as to get me off the phone and get their eyes back on the bottom dollar.

Comcast employees, if you're reading this: You lost my SSN, locked me out of my account less than a month after account creation because my personal account credentials were suddenly signing me into someone elses account (I am not kidding) while refusing to even tell me where to find my own account number & repeating at me that I must ""visit a store"" apparently (to the point at which I could not even ask where to find my account number as no employee would answer this question until I called billing anonymously, gave the last 4 of my card on file and was able to receive the account number for the security department which would repeatedly just hang up on me), associated my credit card details to a different account less than a month after I started service with you. This incompetency is alarming. Cease operations as the incompetent ISP you are and fund Municipal Broadband and classify yourself as a Title II Common Carrier and remove your data caps for all customers. Doing anything less of this poses a threat to the public with the inability to handle personal information.

To compound this, your agents have repeatedly, on recorded calls: Ignored me, hung up on me after ignoring me while I can hear them typing, at one point cited to me a ""federal law"" as their reasoning for having data caps (on a call with the Billing department) which I insisted on being informed about. Only to have the employee say things like ""well, its in the 'Comcast Database'"" and things like ""All countries have laws"" (that was somewhat amusing, I'll admit), then proceeding to ignore me, then put me on hold and then hang up the call on me. This was recorded. I'm still waiting to hear where in the United States Code this law exists, or what FTC/FCC or other federal regulation your employee was referring to. The employee was referring to the AUP and not willing to admit that, I am sure. I have had 9 call backs scheduled and provided Comcast with 2 phone numbers to reach me at. No call backs have ever been made to me from Comcast. 

I could go on.

If you have had issues with a DOCSIS 3.1 device on the Xfinity network, you are entitled to support after you have exhausted your own troubleshooting options with the manufacturer. If they tell you that ""Advanced Repair only works on Comcast devices"", point out to them that the terminology used in the description of the troubleshooting process for customer owned hardware outlines the fact that after completing said troubleshooting, that if the issue is due to the Xfinity network you are entitled to support as the device is certified to work on their network. Comcast discourages customers with psychological tactics designed to manipulate and wear down the consumer to the point of giving up. Comcast is not a competent ISP.

A resolution that Comcast does not want you to pursue is the establishment of even the most basic SLA with a provider like MegaPath (Fusion) constituting best effort uptime on a coaxial connection. It is my understanding that Comcast would be obligated to fix this issue if it were to be presented to them by working professionals in this industry at that level if indeed it is Comcast infrastructure failure and not unaddressed signal ingress due to RF interference, water, etc.

If you have experienced an issue with your DOCSIS 3.1 device on the Xfinity network, feel free to outline your experience here as I had a supervisor from Adv. Repair more or less request this type of information in a roundabout way. This is the first public post I am making on this matter and I have extensive sets of data and follow up to perform. It is my personal goal to establish municipal broadband services and increase the availability and quality of service from providers such as Wireless ISPs (WISPs) after the impact this has had on my life. Any and all data related to incidents like I've described is welcome and will assist me in my goal.

Thank you very much.

"Why I'm no longer a Comcast supporterBack about a year ago, I signed up for Comcast's Gigabit Pro service. I was delighted to have such great internet at my home, and at a super low cost. I told everyone about it. Talked about it twice on Reddit, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/7x6qr6/gigabit_pro/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/8au2n2/before_and_after_of_my_metroe_home_demark/). Posted in industry-specific Facebook groups. Even referred colleagues to sign up. In total, I believe the account rep I was sending these people to had at least 10 people calling him looking to get it set up. No matter how many people told me Comcast was the devil, I was there telling them otherwise. Telling them how great Comcast was. How they're becoming the best ISP in the world. It took a lot for me to say that, as a great friend runs a small local ISP.

About 2 months ago, I decided to move. Called Comcast, explained to the agent that I had an odd account. Was told that it wouldn't be an issue, would be moved without a problem. Called again, confirmed again. Of course, on installation day, the subcontractor cable guy had no idea what I was even talking about. 3 hours later, I settled for cable internet with the idea they'd actually hold up their end of the promise.

2 months after moving, I still don't have my Gigabit Pro service and Comcast is refusing to even look into my case where 2 of their agents told me that it would be moved just fine. Comcast is saying that since it's a specialized service, they do not have the permission to tell customers it'll be moved.

Now, they're telling me I never had it. They (specifically Hakeem, from the escalations department, who's a total brick wall) cannot explain why I had a Juniper ACX2100 on the account. They cannot explain why I paid a $500 installation fee. They cannot explain why there's fiber at a random apartment in Scranton, Pennsylvania. They cannot explain why they can't go back and listen to the 2 calls from when I confirmed the move.

What they can explain is how they're unwilling and unable to do anything at all to waive, decrease, or defer $5,612* of charges they're claiming it would take to get service installed at my residence. No matter how many times I bring up [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/C4TQavj.png), where it was confirmed that I'd have no problems with my new address, they won't even apologize. Great way to treat a paying cheerleader.

(* = $1,012 construction costs, $1,000 installation fee, and $3,600 of additional monthly charges)


Edit: Shoutout to Matt in the executive customer relations team. He was finally able to understand that I did have Gigabit Pro. However, he's still unable to understand how call recording laws work or actually uphold their agents promise. ""Specialized service"" my ass.

"Any Experiences Filing a BBB Complaint and/or FCC Complaint?After years of nightmares regarding service and billing issues with Comcast/Xfinity, I finally filed a BBB complaint a couple weeks ago. I could tell this was likely an exercise in futility, from what I had already read from others online. However, I am forced to use their services and don't have unlimited funds to pay whatever they demand for the same lackluster service since April 2014. 

The woman handling the BBB complaint, Alethia Edwards, and I discussed the ongoing services and billing problems with my account. She said she would do some research, and be back in touch. She called about a week later, last Thursday, but I missed the call. I called her around 8am Friday morning, and again on Monday morning, leaving voicemails each time. By then I was having technical services issues again as well. 

 Ms. Edwards was supposed to be handling this matter for once and for all, never returned my calls to her. She wrote back to the BBB incorrect information on Monday, and stated everything was resolved. WRONG. Since then, I've left her a voicemail stating such, and wrote back to the BBB why I why I consider the matter unresolved. I doubt I'll hear back on that, because Comcast can't follow through on any promise. From her notes, and the errors, I doubt she looked into much of anything. 

She did tell me that she should would also be handing the FCC complaint, if I filed one.  Perhaps, she and I will speak again in the future. If so, I expect nothing but more of the bs, placating and now blaming me for their problems with training, service, infrastructure, billing and supervisors who don't seem to do anything but focus on metrics, sales, and some kind of weird cheer-leading I hear in the background. It must suck to work there. I thought pep rallies ended in high school. Not to mention. the agents who are actually trying to hear customers on their crappy VIOP lines for the few that actually try to do a decent job. 

This is since April 2014...I would give anything to have another company with lines into my building. One of the techs on site once joked the solution was to ""move."" I'm thinking he may have been serious.

"This new channel lineup changeI was trying to watch one of my favorite channels, but was horrified to find that it suddenly was telling me that a subscription was required. I thought this was an error and went to another one of my channels, but got the same message. TBS, TNT, TLC, OWN, FX, MTV, Freeform, Disney, Cartoon Network, Nick, and more, all gone. I went online to the xfinity website to run a diagnosis and system reset, but I was still being greeted by the same ""subscription required"" messages when the TV came back on. I spoke to a technical support rep on the phone, who took a look at my account and informed me that the missing channels should be included based on my subscription, told me that multiple customers in my area were also experiencing the same issue, apologised for the inconvenience, ensured me that she would do every thing to help me get my channels back, and scheduled a technician to take a closer look at the situation and check my cable box in case it needed to be updated. 

The next day the technician shows up and informs me that there is nothing wrong with my box and that the channels are not included in my package. I informed him that can't be possible because I've never changed my cable package for as long as I've been an xfinity customer, and also that the technical support rep told me I was supposed to have those channels. I called technical support again in front of the technician, but this time I was getting a completely different story. This 2nd rep told me he had no idea where the 1st got her info from, but that what had actually happened is that Comcast changed their line up at the beginning of March, and that all my channels were now only part of the Digital Starter package, which is the next package up, and that I would have to upgrade to get these channels. I told him that can't be right because I've had these channels for as long as I've had comcast and it doesnt make sense they are suddenly part of a different package, especially since I was just watching these channels in the 3rd week of March. Then he said that with the package I had before, these were all just ""bonus"" channels that were given to customers with the Digital Economy package for free, and was never meant to be a part of the lineup for that package. 

Now this all sounds like a load of crap and just a massive screw up on Comcasts part. Aside from upgrading or removing the internet from my package, the only change I've ever made to my actual cable subscription is adding Epix to my lineup. I have been a ""valued"" customer for over 3 years, not even counting the years that my family has used comcast under a different account name, and we've always had the same cable package, with the same channels that I suddenly need an upgrade for. About 8 months ago I dropped the internet from our package because our bill was getting too expensive. The only reason I didn't downgrade the cable was because those channels were not included in the limited package, and were only listed as part of my current package and higher. Now some guy on the phone is telling me those channels were never a part of the lineup even though i distinctly recall looking at the website at the time and seeing those channels listed as part of the lineup for the Digital Economy package??? He is telling me that these were just bonus channels, but certainly these bonus channels would have been listed as a temporary promotion SOMEWHERE if that were the case, and that must also mean that I've had these free bonus channels for over 3 years and counting and no one said or did anything about it??? 

After a bit of arguing and a whole bunch of useless apologies from the 2nd technical support rep, he decided to pass me off to a customer solutions rep who proved to be even more useless than he was. Instead of giving me any actual solutions to my problem, this new guy told me that the only thing I could do was upgrade to the Digital Starter package. I told him that I did not want to upgrade to anything or pay any more money just to gain access to channels I've already had access to for *YEARS* up until this past week. My current bill ranges from anywhere between $99-$105 month to month with this current package, even though just 8 months ago my bill was under $80 after i dropped the internet and added Epix. Mr. Customer solutions thought it would be such a good idea for me to just upgrade to Starter and I would ""*only* pay about $120 per month"" for all the channels I wanted. $120 IS HOW MUCH MY BILL WAS LAST YEAR WHEN I DOWNGRADED MY PACKAGE *BECAUSE* IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE. I WOULD BE PAYING THAT SAME AMOUNT TO UPGRADE NOW, AND I WOULDN'T EVEN GET INTERNET OR HOTSPOTS INCLUDED LIKE I DID BACK THEN! As I've already mentioned multiple times before, ALL JUST SO I CAN HAVE ACCESS TO CHANNELS THAT I'VE ALREADY HAD ACCESS TO AND HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR YEARS???! With this current lineup, now there's only about 5 channels that I watch, ( I'm not including all the local channels that I would still have access to anyways WITHOUT paying for cable) yet I'm paying about $100 monthly for that, and it was already too pricy even with the ""extra"" channels. I told him that I refused to upgrade and pay more for channels I've already had, but if he wanted to upgrade my account and keep my bill the same, I would gladly work with him there. He told me that was not possible and I could either pay more with an upgrade to watch my channels, or deal with the channels I had now.

I asked Mr. Customer Solutions to let me speak to a supervisor or a manager, but he informed me that they were all in a meeting, and I could only leave a message. How convenient. He then tells me that they wouldn't be able to do anything anyways, and continues his attempts to persuade me into upgrading my services. I chose to leave the voicemail anyways and left a very long worded message.

The most baffling thing about this entire situation is that two technical support agents for the same company gave me entirely different explanations for my problem, and the customer solutions agent's ""solution"" felt much closer to an ultimatum, because I can either pay more money to get my channels back, or continue to pay what's already an absurd price, but without the channels I've had and cherished for years. ( Yes I said it again for the millionth time. I will NEVER let this go) The next equally baffling thing is that they would make such a change with absolutley no warning. Not a call, not an email, not any physical mail. I feel like I had a rug pulled right from under me. I looked online to see if I could find any complaints, and the only results I found were complaints about changes made in January of LAST year. Rather than inform me before the new year that I was going to lose all my favorite channels unless I upgraded and paid more for a package that was essentially exactly the same as what I currently had, I had to discover that for myself and sit in confusion as I waste time trying to figure out what the heck was happening and why. 

Obviosuly speaking to these reps helped me in absolutely no way. All they provided me with were empty apologies with no reparations, and a whole lot of frustration. I remember the good old days when calling Comcast support with a complaint often resulted in being offered a better package deal at a lower price. And this was as recent as a little over a year ago. I've stuck with comcast all this time because I love their simple, clean layout and television functions/features, especially with xfinity on demand. I've rarely ever had any issues with them for as long as I've been a customer, and when I did, they were subsequently taken care of with ease. This issue, however, is highly unnaceptable and enough to make me want to drop them altogether. Comcast, you need to get your shit together.

"Call rep cannot locate offer listed on xfinity websiteHello,

I went to sign up as a new customer today for internet service and the website for my address listed 29.99 internet for 12 months. However when I call to sign up for this deal, the call rep was very confused because she said that intro deal ended on 3/21 and she does not even see it on her screen. She kept asking if I maybe already had it in my cart from weeks earlier and that’s why it was showing the deal still. I did not, I just added it to my cart before calling.

I removed it from my cart, cleared my browser history/cookies and sure enough the deal is there again. When trying to purchase it I get all the way to the final screen before it says that there is an issue and I need to call. The rep after trying to troubleshoot for a long time and having me send screen shots to her of the 29.99 offer on my screen said she could put me in a higher cost plan for right now to get service and then submit a ticket to have it looked into and later downgraded to the 29.99 plan. I should hear back within 24-48 hours.

What is the deal here? My gut tells me I shouldn’t be confident they will honor the deal despite it still showing as of right now for the the $29.99 price. How can she not see it in her system when plain as day if you put in my address on the website as a new customer it is one of the first plans to show up? I’m just very confused at why what should be a very simple procedure turned into a 45 minute phone call where the resolution still hasn’t come. It doesn’t leave a good initial impression of Xfinity with me. If I can prove I am seeing the $29.99 rate, I feel like the call rep should be able to honor that rate without having to submit a ticket that will take another 1-2 business days to resolve. What’s to stop them from fixing their website (if it is indeed listed erroneously) by the time I get a call back and not honor the current advertised price? It is very frustrating.",0

"Anyone ever use the public ""xfinitywifi"" hotspot instead of home WiFi to save data??So these scam artist data caps have been hitting me pretty hard the last few months. 1tb is nothing with a 300Mbps/down connection with a family of 5 constantly streaming data. We average around 1.2 Tb per month whitch equals to around $40 a month extra. Not enough to spend the extra $10 for unlimited but over what I'd like. From what I understand is that your modem gives off a sort of public hotspot for guests to use so they don't have access to your internal network, and data used on that hotspot doesn't count toward your cap.

UPDATE: This turns out to be a bad router.  Buying a new router allowed everything to work properly.  Super coincidental timing, but it is what it is",0

"Connectivity problem between some Comcast home networksI can reach my home network (Comcast) from anywhere I've tried, except for two friend's homes. (Both Comcast)

The two problematic locations are using different Comcast gateways.  The one that I have been able to test from has a new xFi Advanced Gateway with default settings.

This is what I've been able to test so far (all testing done by verified IP addresses, so DNS is not an issue.):

* From the problematic location, I cannot ping any of 3 different friend's Comcast routers.
* From the problematic location, traceroute to any of the 3 friends dies after the first hop. (LAN IP of the gateway. [10.0.0.1](https://10.0.0.1))  
* All 3 friends can ping each other.
* None of them can ping the problematic location. (ICMP reply is probably disabled.)
* Traceroute from any of the 3 friends to the problematic location all die after several hops, and at the same hop. (Likely the last hop before the problematic router.)

My guess is that the problematic router is dropping the outgoing traffic to the other 3 locations for some reason.  No traffic gets through... not just ping and traceroute.  I've tried accessing multiple services using custom and standard ports.  Nothing works.

All other Internet traffic seems fine.  

Why would the router be blocking access to other Comcast customer IP addresses?

Again, there is another location from which I can't connect to my home Comcast network, but I have not been able to test from there.  I assume I'd get similar results.

Any ideas?",0

"How do I get simultaneous Commercial Internet & Residential TV to the same residential address?So after years of keeping my eyes peeled I found a job as a full time telecommuter in my field. Yay!

I called Comcast today to inquire about the process of upgrading my home internet to a Business/Commercial account in order to get that prioritized traffic & (more importantly) that 4 hour SLA. My job requires I be on-call often, 24/7, and they are willing to pay for business home internet. I have a quote for turning this service on, fairly straight forward. They mention apologetically as an aside that they CANNOT offer Commercial TV to residential addresses, but ... that's fine with me, I don't want or need that.

But then I asked what this would do to my Residential cable TV account bill, because on their ""packaging system"" I know on the residential side it will appear as though I'm downgrading my service instead of upgrading it. Sure enough, first residential rep tells me I will now be paying the same amount/month, for JUST cable TV instead of TV + Internet. Despite the fact that I'm also now going to be paying them $200-$250/mo for business internet. First rep understands that this is kinda fubar, so they transfer me to a loyalty rep who can figure out how to attach special discounts not available to the first guy.

Well I get transferred around a bit before I land at a Residential Loyalty Rep, and she immediately proceeds to tell me that the conversation about my Residential cable TV pricing is moot, because none of their TV boxes work now without having Internet first, and if I don't have a **residential** internet account with them, none of the TV boxes will work. Even if I have a separate business account. They have no way to join these two accounts. 

I had to laugh. I effectively had a Comcast Customer Loyalty Rep telling me that in my quest to spend a small fortune on Internet with them, I would be de facto forcing myself to cut the cord & no longer even be ABLE to get cable TV services from them.

What a stupid fucking company. 

**tl;dr** Need to upgrade home Internet to Commercial services to get that 4hr SLA for a new job. Comcast does not offer Commercial cable TV to residential addresses. Comcast also does not allow their cable TV boxes to work without having an attached Residential Internet account. Upgrading my Internet service is going to forcibly cut my cable TV cord with them, and Comcast still has its own head completely up its own ass.

"Sent to debt collection for not returning a cable box that I never had.This began around 2014/2015. At that time I had only Internet service from Comcast and I used my own modem & router. I was pretty good about fending off their weekly spam calls to ""upgrade"" my service (read: buy more products). But they got me one time. It was the bait and switch. The line was something like ""would like faster internet speed at no cost to you"" and of course, I stupidly said yes, I would like that. Well at the very end of the call it became clear that the faster speed was part of a package that included television service (and I assume a large rate increase after the ""promotional period"" ended). After cursing myself out for a few minutes, I called Comcast back and explained that I changed my mind, I don't want faster Internet and I definitely don't want TV service from them. The End. Or so I thought.



Fast forward some months later, I move from that residence to another state where I am beholden to Time Warner instead of Comcast, so I terminate my Comcast service and move on with my life. Fast forward another month or so and I get a final bill from Comcast that includes a fee for an un-returned cable box. I call them and explain that I never had cable service with them, and that I never had a cable box. They seemed to think that they shipped me one anyway. I refused to pay and we agreed to disagree.

"Free TG1682G from Comcast, worth using?I've always bought my own modem and separate router, but just moved and Comcast is part of our HOA services, and they delivered a TG1682G plus about 150/10mbs (having a hard time finding out what it is supposed to be, but it tests about there or a bit more down).

I have been busy moving and did not take time to swap it out for my own (I usually run a DD-WRT variant). I have been pleasantly surprised that it has been rock stable both in terms of wired and wireless performance.

About the only thing so far I'm missing with DD-WRT that I use is dnsmasq (which I could put on linux and frankly probably work better as the dd-wrt implementation is a bit flakey) and OpenVPN (which I very rarely use, but could probably pass through to linux somehow) and some internal routing (which I can do on the layer 2+ switch I have). 

&#x200B;

I planned to get rid of it, never have trusted their own equipment and never wanted to pay for it.  But it's free (or more precisely whatever I am paying I will be paying regardless).  And it seems solid.

Any good reason not to use it?

&#x200B;

Do they keep it reasonably patched from a security standpoint?

"Absolutely Horrible Customer ServiceSo my family has had Comcast for over ten years now. We’ve always had issues with their service, be it overcharging, ridiculous download limits, confusing service reps, etc. 

On Friday (3/01) my dad called to change his wifi plan. Yesterday we received a router in the mail that we didn’t order from them. He explained explicitly to the rep that he didn’t require any hardware from them. My dad calls customer service (because our internet has been down for hours today) and, after spending thirty minutes trying to get through the automated customer service bot, he gets through to a representative. They inform him that the rep he originally called to change his plan had A) charged him more than they told my dad they would be charging him, B) sent him a router with less capability than he was promised with his plan, and C) scheduled a maintenance appointment with a technician that we did not ask for. 

That original representative told my father that he had been getting charged for going over his bandwidth limit every month for the past year. Due to previous complications with this exact issue at our old house, my dad has been watching the bill to check for overage charges and this was a blatant lie. We don’t have a data limit at all. He also told my dad he was getting charged $50 for every additional 10gb of data used, when in reality the charge in our area is supposed to be $10 for 50gb for customers that have data caps.

My dad is hypothesizing that they shut off our internet in anticipation for us setting up with their proprietary router (we currently use a Netgear modem). None of the representatives he’s contacted has denied that so far. 

This is some real bullshit.

"Using your own X-Fi compatible modem and having unlimited bandwidth much more? Why?So I got on a new promo for the year recently. 

Im getting 250 Mbps with unlimited data and their shipping me out an X-Fi modem.

Basically paying $74.99 ($15/mo for X-Fi-which includes the modem rental fee in the price and $59.99 for the internet speed package)

I called back to see if I could use a X-Fi compatible modem that I would buy and they said that the only way for my to get $15 unlimited vs $50 unlimited would be to use a X-Fi modem ""Only provided by Comcast."" That if I were to bring my own X-Fi compatible equipment it would be $59.99 plus the $50 unlimited.

Whats the deal? Why can't I use my own equipment have X-Fi and not pay the $15. Such an odd system... Its like they want you to not own your own hardware but make it seem like your getting unlimited bandwidth for a ""deal"" ($15 vs $50).",0

"Age old question - Owning your own modem vs rentingHi all! I want your opinions on owning your own modem vs renting from Comcast? I'll note I have 60/10 mbps with Comcast for $63 a month (including modem rental)

I used to have my own modem but any time I had a tech related issue they would basically blame my device. When it was time to get a new modem, I decided to just get Comcast's rental for $10 a month. I got it because they could no longer blame the equipment and I would get the Xfinity wifi hotspot (I use for guests and streaming devices to keep from using too much of my 1TB data cap).

Now, after two years of renting, I am deciding if getting my own modem/router again to save the $10 a month, although, it will take a little over a year for the modem/router to pay for itself, is worth it?  ",0

Their Internet is extremely flaky, sometimes like tonight, the ping is like >300ms, I can't play game with this kind of connection. But usually, when the connect is considered ""good enough"" for me, it never reached the claimed speed of 50Mbps. It was always in the 10M at max 20M.

Talking to an agent didn't help, they always asked me to reset the modem, or power cycle it. Then asked me to connect my desktop to the modem by LAN cable. WTF? The modem is in the living room, and my desktop is in the study room. And I have no laptop that has a LAN port.

Then they proceeded to scheduling an appointment with a technician and said if the problem is not from Comcast, I will have to pay for the service because I use my own modem. WTF again! What if when the dude visits my place, try to find some silly reason to blame it all on me? I would need to pay $1000 for that visit? Fuck no.

What's the best way to file a complaint? Or at least get out of the contract. I'm moving to ATT. Thinking of documenting all the downtime and file a complaint somewhere. Not sure where to start.

After that they looked into promotional deals again and found one I decided to go with. It's a two year contract @ $105/mo, ($6 more than what I pay now).

They also said I can switch to a better promotional offer if one comes up. I'll probably call them in a month or so and see what they have, though if nothing is better it's not a problem because it's normally $140/mo without promotion.

Would also like to mention I’m a big game enthusiast so I take gaming very seriously and it says my internet is fine and the speeds are fine but I go to play a game and I lag so much it’s crazy. So I thought maybe I should hook my Xbox up with a Ethernet and so I did that did In fact boost my speed a lot but I still had lag on the tv’s and my Xbox its like the connection is good but it I lag no matter what. I have unplugged the modem about 40 times over and over but it has yet to help, I also have called Comcast after the fact to see if they could see if anything was wrong and they are sending someone again for the second time tomorrow hopefully. Also it doesn’t help that the first technician was a smart ass saying it was a problem with Microsoft when I had the same internet at my old house and it worked perfect no problem ever! Then I proceed to ask him how is it Microsoft’s fault if the TVs are doing it as well as my computer and Xbox...... then he says well I’m running speed test right now and it says you are getting 150 mbps and I said I know I told you that before the internet is fast but isn’t doing it’s job. He said well it has to be Microsoft it can’t be “Us” (Comcast). Then he thought he fixed it cause it wasn’t doing it at the time but we also told him that like some days it’s fine and other days we can’t even watch tv then like 2 hours after he leaves it starts doing it again.

To the rep who did me a solid: thank you so much! 

To the rest of Comcast: the service is great, but give me an intermediate internet speed for an intermediate price. Currently, I can drop from 250 mbps to 60 and only save $5/month. WTF?

"How to get Comcast to honor their word?Hi All,

TLDR: Comcast refuses to honor package they sold me, and won't revert my service back without me paying extra. 

I'm seeking advise on how to remedy the situation I'm currently in with Comcast customer support. Here is the story:

Here was my plan before the call: Basic cable (without HD service) so roughly 25 channels, HBO and 150 mbps internet for $110/month (including taxes). This information is for reference.

On Tuesday 2/12 I received a call from Comcast about new bundle packages they were offering. The plan that the sales person was pitching was 220+ HD channels with showtime, stars and a Netflix subscription, and also 150 mbps internet for $125/month plus tax. Since I am already a Netflix subscriber, I was willing do entertain this package as it would only cost me an extra $5-10/month after taxes. 

I asked enquired about the Netflix package and was assured that it was the 4k plan with 4 devices streaming at a time. I was reassured by the sales rep that if I wasn't satisfied within the first 30 days I could call back and revert back to my old plan. It all sounded good so I approved the change. I was told by the rep that I would need to restart my cable box and that I would be receiving an email with the new Netflix login shortly after everything goes into effect. 

On Thursday 2/21 my wife asked me if I ever received the Netflix login, which I had not. This prompted me to call customer support. Once on the line I was told that the package that I was expecting was the next tier up from where I upgraded to. They offered to grant me 6 months of either stars or showtime for free, but could not offer Netflix because ""we have to pay that money to Netflix."" I said that misunderstandings happen and I would like to revert back to my previous plan. I was told they no longer offer that plan, and would have to choose a new lower plan, with slower internet for the price I was paying before. I stated that I was only interested in that if my internet speed stayed at 150 mbps to which I was told was an additional $15/month. I asked if they could waive this fee like they can do for the premium channels, and was told no. At this point I asked to speak with a supervisor. Cue supervisor. 

In a nutshell the conversation went the same with the supervisor, he spent much of the time pitching the ""value"" that the higher plans bring with their additional channels, and the ""valve"" of 6 months of a free premium channel. I stated that I watch very little TV, the internet speed is what I value. The conversation came to a halt when I said that because I picked up the phone and agreed to take the offer, my options are to either:

1: Not get what they were offering on the sales call, and pay an additional $27/month for additional channels that I don't care about. 

or 

2: Drop down to a comparable plan to what I had before, pay for the additional internet add-on to keep my previous internet speed, and pay an additional $15/month.

At this point the supervisor said he would pull the recorded sales call, review it and call me back with further options. I accepted this proposal and the call ended.

The next day (Friday) my wife received a call from the supervisor saying he would need another day to review the call, and would reach out to us on Saturday 2/23. We never received a call Saturday, but got an email stating we had a $120 credit on our account. Cue today

I called customer support to ask what this credit on my account is and was told that it would be applied if I upgraded to the next tier account. I confirmed that what they were offering me was a ""free"" 6 months at the next tier, at which point I would have to pay the $150+ amount for that package. The rep confirmed, and I said I'm not ready to make that decision now, and ended the call. 

Through all of these calls I was repeatedly told that ""we can only apply packages and discounts that are in the system"" and ""we can't do anything else for you."" 

Does anyone here have any advise experience in contacting someone at Comcast that can actually make changes on accounts to honor what their sales people pitch? Any help here is greatly appreciated. ",0
"Can Comcast double bill me for both business and residential on the same line during the same period of service?Last month my roommate and I moved to a new, smaller apartment unit when our third roommate moved out. We had a business plan for the 3 of us and I transferred that to the new unit, but then about a week or two later canceled that service (within the 30 day money back guarantee period) and began residential service at that address. This transfer was on January 25th and the change to residential was on February 5th.

When the bill for the first month of the business service came in, I paid the installation/transfer fee without complaint as that was disclosed up-front as being non-refundable. There was one month's charge for service on the bill, which didn't entirely surprise me as I figured that bill may have been pre-generated and the amount might be refunded the following month. I paid both by the due date to make sure nothing became delinquent, and then called in (which was a pain in the ass to say the least) to find out what was going on. The guy I talked to said the money back guarantee would be honored, a check would be cut to me for the refundable amount, gave me a date to expect the check to be sent, and gave me a ticket number.

This week I've received a bill for a second month of business service. I thought maybe this was the refund being documented, but it's a charge for another month's worth of service. I opened a chat support with a guy who was useless and just advised me to call the 800 number and speak with Retention. He said my service was not disconnected on February 5th, but that it takes 60 days to fully disconnect service. Before calling I wanted to do some digging, see what other information I could gather, post here, etc.

The disconnect request documentation does state that the request serves as a 60 day notice. However, service was clearly disconnected on the 5th when the residential service took over. Business chat support has confirmed for me that they don't see my modem on the account; they state I still have service but just don't have a modem connected right now. Other questions I asked went nowhere (have there been any changes to the account? when did the modem go offline? do I have an IPv4 or IPv6 address lease? etc.).

This is only for about $70 and I feel like if I bark up the tree long enough I can get it refunded, but to me they are double dipping by trying to charge me for both residential and business services on the same cable line. It's not a huge amount of money, but I think it's unethical, assuming it's legal, for them to play the billing game this way.

On the subject of ethics, the 30 day money-back guarantee **is** disclosed on the original transfer contract, but the 60 day required notice for termination is **not**; the first documentation I can find with that on it is the request itself, so that definitely feels like a gotcha.

How would you proceed here?",0

It became regular, so I figured I'd reach out to Comcast, a tech came  out, wasn't able to be at the property at the time it happens, so said  he'd monitor it, as nothing appeared wrong with the cabling, but he did  manage to switch out the X1 boxes, as they were old? Anyways. He told me text him if it didn't get resolved, first text, I got the  reply he was still seeing issues on the line and they'll fix it, next  text, no reply.

&#x200B;

So, I called again, got another tech out, he went through most of the  same stuff, although, he states the splitter was old, and one of my  wires under the crawl space was spliced and needed replacing and even though the first tech (up above) said he was unable to do it due to  regulations, this guy went along and replaced all the wiring, hoping it  was the fault. He couldn't be around for the time, so I let him know it  didn't work. \[as this guy promised me he'd text me back, which he did\]

&#x200B;

So, he figured it could be a few things, and to avoid at the moment  me spending any money, he opted to look/replace the Comcast stuff. So,  The gateway got replaced, different brand, nope didn't fix it. He  suggested it could be the wire that runs from the cable to the outside  of the home (I think he called it the drop cable) he replaced that.  Still going on. So he spoke to a fellow tech, who like I thought they  may do at some point,  blamed my hardware.

&#x200B;

Now, I did think it was my Netgear router, and I posted stuff in  forums way before I reached to Comcast, my router didn't have a a  scheduled reboot and I even went to the extent of re-flashing a custom  firmware in case it was my firmware that was corrupted. Even with that,  it still did that. Now, to appease the 'router question' I went out and bought a brand  new router (same make and model) and installed it, it still did it, it  still lost connection at a fixed time \[give or take a minute or two\]

&#x200B;

So, the next suggestions was to put take the router out of bridge  mode (as I have my own router), which I wasn't too happy with, as I  don't like cross networking, having 10.x.x.x and 192.x.x.x on the same  network (and I wasn't changing my IP's to match). I did notice though I  was having issues getting to some pages, probably cross networking. But,  anyways, that didn't help either. I was still getting disconnects.

&#x200B;

All this time the lights stay the same on the gateway.

&#x200B;

The second tech was still helping and thinking about other things and  coming back to me via text message. But I'm looking for other suggestions, to maybe tell him. An IT buddy of mine mentioned it may be  the gateway heartbeat for the wireless that is offered to Xfinity customer, so I asked the tech if he had a docsis3.0 normal modem to take  that out the equation, but he doesn't. I don't want to be spending more money on a modem with phone support, just to take the gateway out the equation. 

&#x200B;

So, I've got a brand new wiring, brand new gateway, brand new router  (no custom setting within the router) and yet I'm getting disconnects,  the 18.38 one can vary by a minute or too, but the 7.30am happens at  7.30am every morning.

&#x200B;

To put the icing on the cake, I'm a content creator and stream, so I  don't need to be online and lose connection through no fault of my own.

&#x200B;

Now it appears this next tech is also dropping of the face of the earth, I've not heard from him in two weeks and the text I sent 2 days ago hasn't been replied too.

&#x200B;

Thoughts? Any things I can try, maybe someone who's good with  networks/scripting knows a way I can trace-route, maybe find a failure  point? I'm 99.99999% sure it's not my equipment, or only my PC would have it happening, etc

"Intermittent packet lossI've been having this issue for months and now the weather is getting colder again (30-40F), the issue seems to be more frequent again (we had a rise in temperature from 60-75F maybe a week or so ago). I had a tech come out and figure out that the lines outside were cracking and they needed to found and corrected (this was back in 1/25/2019) but I can't figure out if it was ever corrected (not entirely at least). Tried contacting support, one person tells me there are issues in the area that are being fixed and I asked someone again today about this issue and they tell me there was no issues in the area.

I've already scheduled another tech to come out to do the same thing as the guy did back in the January. The funny thing is..all the signals look fine and I can browse the web and watch videos (like on YT or Twitch) without much issue..but when I play games or try to stream, it's not stable at all. When I'm in discord, I can see my packet loss occurring as the signal indication dips into yellow and red intermittently when I'm in the server and then back to green (I'm getting cut out when I'm talking to people).

This has only been running for a few minutes now, but every time there is packet loss, my ping jumps up to 111+ (yellow indication) and now I'm either losing stream connection or my character in-game is teleporting back and forth. I've also had some random cutouts where I have to restart my modem to my connection back. I think my upstream is also taking a pretty major hit, but all the signal levels are fine.

Edit: I know the issue was only reported back in January, but you would not notice it unless you were playing a game or streaming. Once you run a pingplotter, you start to notice packet loss ever 1-4 minutes. Back in January, it was almost ever 1-2 minutes I would get a red line indicating packet loss and ping spikes.

Update 2/23/2019: The issue ended up being electrical noise on the lines outside. After fixing the issue, the tech reset my modem remotely and there hasn't been an issue since.",0
"HOW can I lower my bill without getting the runaround on the phone?!I've tried SEVERAL times to lower my Comcast  bill over the past year. I have the ""$89"" Triple Play, but really with fees etc., it's more like $150/mo.

"Life 11 months after cancelling my Comcast account.This is copy pasted from [Facebook](https://bit.ly/2NdDt0X):

I posted this to the Xfinity page, but it doesn't appear that they allow for public posts (imagine that). Here we go with the proper hastags. #xfinity #comcast #comcastic

Up until 11 months ago, I had been a Comcast customer most of my adult life. My parents had Comcast when I lived at home, my roommates and I had Comcast while I was in college, and my wife and I had Comcast all 3 places we've lived since we got married nearly 10 years ago.

Up until that point, my only real problem with Comcast had been the introductory rate trick they use to gouge customers after they've been signed up for a few months. It’s a shady business practice IMHO, but Comcast is hardly the only company out there doing that to their customers.

11 months ago, I cancelled my Comcast account. I did this specifically because monthly data caps had been applied to my account with no communication from your company that this was happening. I only found out AFTER I had already gone over the monthly allowance AND used both of my freebie months for doing so.

When I went to cancel, I was told that an email HAD been sent out announcing this. Since I don't delete emails, I was able to go back through every communication from your company to me and saw that, in fact, I was being lied to. There was never any communication sent out.

In the 11 months since I cancelled my account with Comcast, I have dealt with the following:

1. Numerous calls harassing me to return equipment that I had already returned directly to a Comcast store.

2. New equipment being sent to my house 8 months after I cancelled the account. When I called to let you guys know that I would be happy to slap a shipping label on the box to return it to you, I was told I would be charged for the equipment if I didn't physically deliver said equipment to a Comcast or UPS store. It took 45 mins of arguing over the phone to get you guys to agree that the shipment wasn't my fault and returning the equipment wasn't my responsibility.

3. Getting sent to collections 11 months after cancellation for an amount I never got billed for (which turned out to be some portion of my final bill). There were no follow-up bills/emails/calls, just straight to collections. This was also never mentioned by any of the numerous associates I talked to on the phone. When I log on to my account online, I didn't have any means by which to pay the bill since I no longer had an account with you guys... I had to call you, yet again. On principal I wanted to fight this charge, but I'm just too tired. You can have your final $48.68.

Feel free to fact check any of this information. I know you recorded all of these conversations, so you should have full access to all this information.

Now what am I expecting Comcast to do to make this right? Nothing. Why would I expect ANYTHING from Comcast after all of this?

So why am I writing this? Easy: I've been told that the only way to have my complaints heard by your company is to air my dirty laundry on social media in front of the world. I hate that this is my only recourse against what would traditionally be categorized by almost anybody as ""shameful business practices.""

You win. You're system is so broken that I have to resort to this. I hate it. It's teaching our youth that screaming in a public forum is the only way to get anything done. It's setting a bad precedent for America.

I know you guys do a lot of work to maintain your social media, so I’m sure this will get deleted. Shame on you regardless.

Please stop harassing me.

EDIT:
I've been in contact with Comcast support via Facebook for a couple of days now.  They suggested a phone call to clear things up quicker, but would not consent to have the call recorded.

I have asked for a public apology on this.  They haven't refused outright but continue to claim they don't have the ability to do so.

I will happily release full transcripts of my interactions with them once this issue is closed/resolved, for transparency's sake.  I don't want to do that now as they haven't formally said ""No"" to my request for a public apology.  

If they made me complain in a public forum to get anything done, I expect them to do so as well.",0

"Getting Rid of ComcastHi Reddit,

&#x200B;

I've always been the type of person to never set up automatic payment so I can keep better track of my personal finances. After finally giving in due to a few late payments, I decided to check my costs at the end of the year. I think the original rate I was paying was somewhere around $100 for internet and cable.

https://i.redd.it/4ociiw1stmh21.png

I was told by a rep over the phone that I can turn in the DVR box to save $10 a month. I went to the local store and after waiting in line for 40 minutes was told that I can't drop the box off and the rep over the phone didn't know what she was talking about. I didn't want to press the issue too much because Comcast has a terrible reputation for lying and misleading. All I use is internet for streaming/gaming(league of legends). My sig. other only watches 3 channels(lifetime, history, bravo, cnn). Is something like Sling TV worth it? I see $25 + $5 for all the channels I would need but I don't know if they have all the BS charges like Comcast. As for internet I see AT&T offers DSL for  ""Speeds up to 100 Mbps."" for $40. Is it worth it to break everything up or just stick with the bundle and suck it up?

"Comcast’s 1 TB limit is garbageI will start by saying I have been a Comcast customer since 2013 and have been dealing with their bullshit ever since. From their resistance to me buying my own equipment, to them unexpectedly raising my bill with no warning whatsoever, and now this 1 TB shit? 

I’ll do some quick math for everyone: 

1 TB = 1024 GB 
1 GB = 1024 MB
1 TB = 1,048,576 MB

(Please note that my units are correct)
“B” = Bytes
“b” = bits 

That being said, I pay for 150 Mbps, which 
is ~16 MBps (1 Mb = 0.125 MB) 

So my 1 TB would theoretically take 65,536 seconds to download

65,536 seconds 
1092.267 minutes 
18.204 hours

I know this probably doesn’t equate straight across like I am presenting it, but Comcast is basically saying: 

“Yup, go ahead and use your 150 Mbps! You’ll love it! Just know that you’ve only got 18 hours at that speed before you hit your data limit!” 

Comcast can take their 1 TB and shove it where the sun don’t shine because that is an absolute load of shit. 

Oh by the way, it is possible to use over 1 TB because I’ve been charged $160 in additional charges which equates to 800 GB of additional data. 


EDIT: 
To add to that time comparison, if I used my internet for a 1/4 of the total time in a month, I would have to limit myself to 1/16 of my bandwidth to not go over ",0

"Charged $500+ due to Comcast’s errorMight be a long post. So I moved back in August and immediately upon moving in I plugged in my box and router and called Comcast to transfer my service to my new address. No problem. Within minutes of the phone call, my tv and internet are working great.

Fast forward 5 months and I notice an issue with my bill on the my account app. I only noticed because my service had been disabled so I looked at my bill. The amount resembled what I have been paying for 2 years which is why I didn’t notice that the address was somewhere halfway across the country and my name was different (ie not me). I called and after the Comcast ringer I discovered that my old account had never been cancelled and my current addresses account had gone delinquent for 5 months of non payment. 

I work in customer service and I understand the script these people have to go through all day so I was patient and on the phone for two hours. Finally the right representative was able to get my old address finally disconnected (the tenants who moved into my old apartment had still been using my service on my dime) and taken off my bill and I was assured all was good. 

Not good. A few weeks later my app hasn’t updated with my current address so I call back and 1 hour later I get connected with the right guy who is able to fix my account app so I can accurately see my bill. To my very pissed surprise my account states that I am $550 ish past due. Two more hours later I am assured that all of my payments on my previous address will be transferred over to my current account and all will be hunky dory after some department reviews my case.

Fast forward to today. My service has been suspended due to non payment. I call. Again. They state that the correct department is closed. No problem. Hang up. Call back. Insist that their must be someone who can help me. Sort of. Turns out that department that had to review my account said that the money taken from my bank to pay each bill had already been applied to my old account and cannot be transferred. 

So no I have a 1 day extension so I can call tomorrow and hope that my problems will finally be fixed.

TLDR: Comcast didn’t cancel my old addresses account soo continued to pay for it while my current addresses account went delinquent for non payment. Now I owed $500+.",0

"Should I sign up for XFi Advantage for the included unlimited internet?I have my own router and modem and have just used the second complimentary month of overage (data cap of 1TB, co-op house with 12 people who all stream netflix, $10 per 50GB of overage, we used 1700GB last month. Essentially, unlimited data is required). I called about the $25 unlimited data promo, but they said that it has been replaced by the XFi modem/router rental for $15 a month which includes unlimited data. Without the promo, unlimited data is $50 a month.

Is there any reason not to get their modem? They said on the phone that I can put it in bridge mode (which would turn off the wifi hotspot and everything else) and use my own router. As far as I can tell I could get unlimited for $15 instead of $50 this way and nobody in the house would know the difference.

I personally see no reason not to do it, but I don't want to get blindsided by something.

It'll be the XB3 router/modem from the calls I've made. That should suffice for 150mbps down.

"Free internet on accidentSo this is kind of a long story. We recently built a house and moved in about 3 months ago. I had Comcast go by the house and make sure it was serviceable about a week before we moved in. They said it was. The day after we move in they come by to install the service. Two techs came out and said it would not be possible and that I would have to get construction out here to run the lines first. I was upset obviously because they told me the week prior that it was serviceable. The problem was that our house is about 400 feet off the road where the cable is. So then started the saga of contacting Comcast to try to get someone out here to estimate the cost of running the lines. I couldn't get any movement from residential and was told to contact Comcast business. This did get things moving faster but when we got the estimate after about 2 weeks we were floored. They said the cost would be $20,000!! Yes you read that right. Anyhow, the reason (they claimed) was because their cabling at the road was at its limit and they would have to put in a new node, power supply, tap, and half inch hard line up to our new house. They said they would cover some of the cost but never could give me an answer as to how much. So at this point we were obviously trying to come up with other ideas. I called a friend of mine who used to work for Comcast. He said he wasn't surprised with the situation and the cost but didn't think it was necessary. To be sure he came by and measured the tap at the road and said it was red hot. So he said to get some RG 11 w/ messenger and he'll run the line and use an amp if necessary. I paid about $300 for a 1000ft spool. Contrast that with Comcast's claim that the cable itself was going to cost me $10,000 alone. So he comes out a few days later and hooks it up. The run ended up being just under 500 feet so we were expecting the signal to be quite degraded at the house. To our surprise, the signal was still good at around 0 to -2 dBmV.  So now the trick was to call Comcast and get them to activate the service. I had my own modem from my previous address so I just needed to call and get them to activate it. I spent probably 6 hours talking to different reps until I finally was able to get someone to activate the modem without sending a tech out first. They kept saying a tech needed to come out to see if it was serviceable since it was a new construction, but we obviously were trying to avoid that. Since they could see the modem was up and had power someone finally agreed to send it a signal and it activated. They emailed me a contract which I signed and I have a static public IP. The thing is, my address is still listed as unserviceable when I look it up online, and when I bring up my account online it says I don't have service. But I do have service and have for almost 3 months. My name and address are correct on my account online as well. At this point I'm not sure what to do, getting free internet is great but don't know how long it will last and can see trouble in the wind. We have to have high speed internet because my wife works mostly from home. Anyone have any ideas as to what may have happened? Or what I should say if I call in and say I'm not getting a bill?

"Purchase modem?AT&T is more than I can afford now that my contract is ending and the best they can do isn't worth my time, so I'm switching over to Comcast, unwillingly. Should I buy my own modem or rent from them?

"Another Rise in Monthly BillingFrom the 1st day I signed up for Xfinity, the bill has never been what was promised when I signed up.  It's always higher.  Every month there's a new fee, increased something charge, something new every time to raise the bill.  


Last year, an agent provided me with a one time credit to make up for all the broadcast and sports fees.  With that one time payment, I agreed to another year of service at $122 per month.  That was April 2018.

&#x200B;

Now Feb 2019 - woops, the fees have increased and it's now $126 per month, $2 more than I would have paid if I had switched to DirecTV and Centurylink.  


Called, but the agents do nothing but read me legal terms.    


I signed up for a year for $122 per month and only because Comcast had credited to make up for the broadcast and sports fees.  That was a $2 savings over DirecTV/Centurylink.  Boom - now it's $2 more than DirecTV/Centurylink.

Your attitudes & how you run your company is Solid proof of this.

"Comcast sent me to collections after telling me I owed no moneyAbout half a year ago I returned Comcast equipment to its store and talked to the agent in store what money I owed before closing my account. They looked through my account and said I owed $200 and closed my account saying I didn’t owe anything more. I have not received any notification from them since. 

Fast forward to this past weekend...
I found out I was sent to collections by Comcast for $150. So I called and asked Comcast what this was about. The first agent said it was some backcharge from some previous thing and said they didn’t know why the agent didn’t tell me I owed more money. I asked to speak to the supervisor and they said I didn’t need to do that because they had all the information and that they would send me proof to my email. We hang up. Nothing arrives in my email.

Later that day I call back. Another agent picks up and we repeat conversation. They say that they can help and that their supervisor will call me back to help me with this case and to call collections to have this charge removed. Once again no calls received from them since. 

What do I do moving forward from here? Do I just state that I will not hang up until I can speak with a supervisor who can help? I do not want this on my credit record for the next 7 years just because they forgot to tell me I owed money when I asked them. ",0
"Packet loss on all my devices ranging from 1%- 160% packet lossRecently I have been getting a lot of packet loss throughout the day. I have a ARRIS  tg3482g modem router and I have 250+ mbps download and around 20+ mbps upload. I have been getting this problem for about a month now and it really affects my gaming because of the major spikes in packet loss. This makes it very hard to play, but this not only happens on my xbox one when I get the packet loss, it happens on my phone, and rarely my computer, but it does happen. I have had 3 new modems from xfinity, had new wires installed from inside and outside my house, and even changed my ethernet cable. We usually have around 7-10 devices connected. This includes things like my xbox one, phones, and computers. Even though this may seem like a lot this devices we pay enough for the service that is supposed to be provided.

"Gig speed and personal modem = mystery to Comcast employeesFacts: 
I am a Double Play customer with TV and Gig Speed service using a Netgear Nighthawk CM1100 modem. I bought this modem on day 2 of having Gig Speed. The modem is approved by most internet providers, including Comcast. 

So here’s the thing, providing tv and internet service must be hard. It must be as difficult as operating on a fetal heart. Well, that’s the idea I’m getting based on the past 3 weeks of dealing with Comcast folks on the phone, via Twitter, via Forums, and in person at an Xfinity store. 

This all started when my monthly rate jumped $65. I called Comcast on January 21 to try and get a new promotion. You know, the song and dance...

The person on the other end wasn’t able to do anything for me in terms of making changes because they said I couldn’t have Gig speed internet without renting their modem. I asked if they knew, or could see, that I was running my own modem and even went as far as explaining a technician came to my house about a week into my service, thanks to ComcastElla of the company forums, and adjusted a few things so I’d get the consistent performance a Gig Speed customer would expect. I asked for a supervisor who was able to find me a promotional rate for Double Play Latin. I’m not Latin. I was surprised. He said not to worry. It’s just random where promotions come up. Go figure. When he tried to apply that promotion, he couldn’t. He said my personal modem on the account was causing an error to show up. After 85 minutes, I thanked them, rudely, for their time. 

January 23, I figured I’d go to the local store and speak with a human being in person. The rep I had (who hasn’t answered emails I’ve sent recently) did a good job of getting me a plan that was about $10 higher than I was paying. Considering the mental torture I had a few days prior, I took it. She said there’d be a $70 charge for the Gig Speed, even though I had it. She said her manager would remove it. I trusted them.

A week later, I noticed that the $70 wasn’t removed, so I called Xfinity. The person I talked to made me feel confident they’d remove the $70 charge. The next day, I had 2 more $70 charges. Insane!

This is when I took to Twitter, first plug locks, then via DM. Usually, going the Twitter route is better, but it’s been almost 10 days or so of ZERO progress being made. 

The gist: I must be the only person who uses their own modem, or the CM1100, specifically. Nobody at Comcast can figure out how to get the error they receive when trying to do ANYTHING on my account. I’ve asked for SOMETHING for my troubles and frustration, like a premium channel or two. Guess what? They can’t do it because they get errors. I had a local customer care rep call me last Sunday who said “they’re working on it” and then she called back on Thursday night, this time asking me to drop down to 350 megabit per second service. I told her no way because I get Gig Speed service as it is already. She said she’d file a ticket with the “highest group” responsible for that sort of thing. I asked why she or anyone else hasn’t done this sooner. She didn’t have an answer. I’ve tweeted a few more times to check in, and based on the random agent who answers, I still get the generic answer of “keep waiting”, more or less. 

I’ve even helped them think outside their own mental box. I suggested they try to build me a new account, from scratch. I don’t think anyone I’ve suggested this to has the aptitude to understand what I’m suggesting. Sad. Very sad. 

Who else can I deal with there? How hard can this be?

"Software getting worse?Does anyone feel like in general, XFINITY software is getting worse, not better?

First they had to drop remote scheduling of recordings in the app. I get that that was a legal challenge, but damn, I was doing that almost 20 years ago.  Their lawyers couldn’t find prior art or strike up a licensing deal? 

Recently I lost the ability to easily return and delete shows downloaded to my iPad, after I watch them.  It used to prompt me, now it’s several steps to do the same thing. Any why can’t I revoke a show from my primary box.  I have to track down who downloaded the show, make sure the device is charged up, online, etc. 

Show padding and sports extension seems worse than it was before. 

I registered my favorite college team, and it prompts me to tune to other colleges in the same state, or a different sport. 

I set it to record the John Oliver Show and it records the Smurfs and Rick and Morty and a bunch of other stuff, just because he has a part on those shows.   I can’t look through a list of set recordings anymore. 

My DVR has more space than the online DVR, so if it gets too full, it deletes older shows online and I can’t stream them anymore. ",0
"Keep getting spammed with calls for unused equipment I gave back. Even answered and got a representative that said everything was fine. What do?So I rented an apartment while I was in college and had Comcast. 


* This was a place located right next to campus and they basically only rented to students so they had check-in days like they do at the dorms where you set everything up.

* I asked the guy who set everything up what to do when I move out and he told me that the way the place works is that I just leave my equipment  in my apartment when I move out (only had internet so just a modem). 

* Fast forward to last May where I graduate, cancel my service, and move out of the place. I leave equipment in the apartment as instructed.

** *
Two months later I start getting spammed with these automated calls about returning equipment.

* I check my account and nothing is stated as outstanding.

* My mailing address was a separate one from the apartment, and i received all bills there. Since the final bill, I've received nothing.

* I answer the automated call and talk to a guy who is obviously in or from another country, and explained the above.

* He informs me everything is just fine and I stop getting calls.

** *

Calls then stop for a few months but then resume

* I have since been getting constantly spammed everyday with these calls
* It's been 7 months since I cancelld and I still see nothing in the mail or otherwise stating I owe anything.
* Nothing on my credit has been affected

** *

So is this a scam? 

Otherwise what the hell is happening, and how do I make it stop?

"Seven months later and no refundI had an account that was overcharged before it closed in August 2018. They owed me $65.90, no big deal right? I returned the equipment but for some reason this never reached their records.

I have gone through so many customer service representatives who have all told me that ""my account was notated with the mistake"" and that I'd receive the check soon. I've had multiple service tickets and every time I check on them I'm told that they were automatically closed because of the unreturned equipment. I was getting incessant phone calls from their debt collectors until I finally solved it on that end but they just won't send me my god damn check.

I've been at this for seven months.

"Xfinity Mobile refused to send my phone to my address, then yelled at me when I called seeking a solution 

My family recently made the mistake of switching to xfinity mobile from Verizon. My mom was enticed by the cheap unlimited data plan, my brother by the device special. At first it honestly seemed like it might be worth it. The service has been identical to Verizon's, and cheaper.

Today I tried to buy an iPhone XR, and I'm now 100% convinced we should have stayed with Verizon.

I go to school at the University of Alabama. Home is in Michigan, which is where my mother's address has the xfinity internet service.

As I discovered when going to checkout, it turns out that is the only place xfinity will send the phone.

I figured surely an exception could be made, so I went ahead and called customer service. After the usual runaround I spoke with a rep who told me they can't break that rule. What a joke! As if it's impossible to separate shipping from billing smh.

I explained to her I live NOWHERE NEAR THERE and she casually told me I should have my mom ship it to me, as if that's no inconvenience whatsoever.

My mother is widowed and certainly has better things to do with her time.

I say ok, can Xfinity at least cover the cost of extra shipping? Silence for about five seconds. I repeat to her, ""Can you do that?"" And at this point she screams at me that my mom's address is the one xfinity has on file and there's nothing that can be done.

"Slow performance w/ 1gbit and owned modemI have tried two owned modems Netgear CM1000 and Arris SB8200 and both give me worse performance than when I had Blast (250Mbps).  They are both Docsis 3.1.  

I have had a tech come out, and they looked at everything and it all looked good.  They tried their own and it worked and I got 940Mbps, so I went out and bought the SB8200 which is doing the same as the other modem.

"Northeast US internet has been trash lately.Not sure where else I could have put this. Sorry. 

Packet loss and latency fluctuations are pretty bad. Not quite sure if it's Comcast or a backbone provider. Just asking if anyone else has been having the same problems in the NY/NJ/PA area.

"FCC Complaint for Comcast Business 60 Day Notice?Swapping my office phone line and internet to ATT because Comcast has raised by bill from $100/$140. 

Called retentions to see if they can keep me. Not only they did not budge, they also threw me a 60 day notice. I checked my contract that I signed 4 years ago. No where does it say 60 day notice. Retentions also emailed me a docusign saying I need sign in order to cancel. On this form it shows 60 days notice recognition. 

&#x200B;

I heard filing a FCC complaint will get Comcast attention to waive the 60 day notice? Is this true? Have you had this experience? ",0
"Does anyone know of a good email to contact Comcast?Used to be able to use this email (We_Can_Help@cable.comcast.com) and get help with getting my bill lowered, change services, etc, and apparently that email is now dead. Did they end up making a new one that anyone knows about? Because paying 100 bucks a month for 150 down, and them offering gigabit for 110 bucks is a wee bit ridiculous.

Thanks, all.

"Internet connection issues (Long Wall of Text)For a week now I have have issue with my internet. Packet loss, websites slow, no internet. I started this adventure with 250mbts blast pro, and my own netgear cm1000 modem with a linksys AC2200 router. I have about 15 devices and last month i blew through 1653gb of data.

&#x200B;

I have known for awhile now that my cable modem signal is out of spec, but for the life of me I cant figure out how to explain this to comcast/xfinity. 

My Modem Diag:

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/9vtafsvxend21.png

From what I have read the power is off. (should be between -7 and 7 dbmV) But to tell Comcast that is like I am speaking Greek. Then my internet went out last Wednesday. A call to Comcast went well, the tech was helpful, and understood that I tried on my own and skipped their trouble shooting steps. But, he couldn't get a signal from my modem and because it was mine and not theirs so they couldn't help me. So they scheduled a tech to come out and they warned that I would have to pay if I was at fault. I already have to pay $261 for my overages, whats another $70 for a tech visit.

&#x200B;

The tech came out in a Xfinity branded van and began his trouble shooting. Signal was fine to him, and my modem was showing good connection, but no internet to speak of. I tried everything, new cable, dropping the router, resetting, rebooting, re-provisioning, no internet, but the modem would shot good/connected. He ran a new thicker gauge cable and still nothing, tried different ports on the tap(the box my house connect to in my neighbor's yard). NOTHING. We  gave up and he left. About 15 minutes after he left, BAMO, I had internet again. (WHAT THE HELL)

&#x200B;

Saturday morning it was out again. Modem showed Connected but no internet in the house. Call to Comcast was less helpful as the tech would not allow me to skip trouble shooting my side. Jesus Christ that was painful.

&#x200B;

C: ""Sir, are you on Windows 8, Windows 7...""

M: ""I am on Windows 10""

C: ""Are on on Wifi or Wired""

M: ""Wired""

C: ""OK, I need you to click on the Apple Logo in the top left and goto System Preferences""

M: ""I am on Windows 10, not Mac""

C: ""Ok, click on the Wifi icon in the bottom Right""

M: ""I am direct Connect Wired into the modem""

C: ""Open the stat menu and type CMD""

&#x200B;

Yeah, that's how the call went. I was never rude but Jesus Christ I wanted to strangle some one. After that torture I managed to get them to try things on their end. And they couldn't get the boot record from my modem. 

&#x200B;

C: ""We are sorry sir, but we cant get a boot record from your modem. as it isn't one of ours we cannot trouble shoot further.""

&#x200B;

I was so tired of her I let the call end and when about my errands for the day. After my errands I went to my local Xfinity store to obtain a Comcast Modem. While their they looked at my account and mentioned that I was in a area with Gigabit. Fucking finally, I was tired of waiting and promptly upgraded as my bill would be lower than my current. I threw in unlimited internet so I would have to deal with overages and left with a new modem. I got home and guess what, same issue. 

&#x200B;

The new xFi modem would connect to the internet but I couldn't get a out side connection. 

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/wvpbqj7wlnd21.png

And, again, the signal was out of spec. Go for another call to Comcast and again I couldn't skip the trouble shooting. Thankfully they didn't try to deep dive my system and moved onto testing their side of things. Hey, they still cant get a boot img from their modem. Its their modem so they cant stop trouble shooting my issues. 

&#x200B;

C: ""We need to send out a technician""

M: ""Again? Fine, when?""

C: ""Monday at one.""

&#x200B;

Sigh, 2 days I have to wait. Tech shows up in a unmarked van(a old ford aerostar)  and proceeds to try to help me. We cant get it to work, I have to explain to him at length basic network things and I try to figure out what he is trying to do. He doesn't like how I setup the modem, swears the signal is good and proceeds to swap out my modem with another. After fiddling around in my neighbors back yard and switching from my 3ft coax cable to his new 3ft cable the internet is working again. He leaves, I move my modem back to the other side of the room on a 25ft coax and proceed to play around with my new Gigabit internet. Ignoring the cable signal that still out of balance. 

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/dk5m0kx1ond21.png

Tuesday I spend all day at work and assume I will be returning home to no internet. Funny enough I had internet, and its was working fine. Wednesday comes around, get of work and I still have internet. Except now instead of a Gigabit I am getting barely 20 Megabits. But I'm getting my 35 Megabit upload? [https://imgur.com/a/7JYTsdF](https://imgur.com/a/7JYTsdF)

&#x200B;

Hokay, lets call Comcast again. Yay, she skipped my end of trouble shooting and now she is trying her end. Ooops, she has the wrong mac address. Ok, now we have the boot img, and I am setup for Gigabit. Still getting 20mbits, cant figure out why. Schedule another tech visit, tomorrow at 3. Fine. Hang up after the conversation ends and go do chores. 

&#x200B;

30 minutes later I mess a 1-800 number that leaves a voice mail saying its Comcast and I need to call back. Its their advance tech support. Oh goody, maybe they can help. Nope... He proceeds to log into my modem, turn of bridge mode, and tell me my wifi has the same name(2.4 and 5ghz) and it needs to be changed. He does this and immediately says he fixed it and my internet should work now. No, it still giving me 2mbits and I was never on wifi goddammit. Ok, they need to send a tech out to get hands on my modem. Fine, it wont help but fine.

&#x200B;

Around the time I was finishing up this wall of text Comcast called again and asked how long I was having issues. And, they would be sending a tech out to check all my connections. Jesus, do you think I didn't try that?

&#x200B;

OK, thanks for reading this wall of text, on to my questions. Am I right that my signal is out of spec? If so, how in the hell do I tell Comcast this? I have tried every way I can think of and they wont listen to me. I have gone through 3 modems and each one has let me down. Right now I am limping along while paying $180 a month speeds I know I can get. This is a yearly thing that happens. I live in Houston and my selection still sucks, its Comcast(up to a gigabit), Att(25mbits - not fiber ready), and DSL. ",0
"Should i get my own Modem/router duo?Just got xfinity 150 Mbps for the first time, internet/cable. Should i buy my own modem? If so any recommendations?",0
"Can I call and complain to get credit?My internet has been out like every other day, always in the evening when I am home and never back before I go to sleep.  I work 2nds and am up until 2am.  It's getting annoying paying for shit that only works half the time.",0
"Trouble shooting helpHow can I determine what is causing my internet to be slow? I pay for 25 mbps however when I check my speed it usually shows download speeds of 5 +/- 2, and upload speeds around 2. I have contacted Comcast many times and they always say something along the lines of ""we will check your signal"" and then say ""we fixed your signal, it should be good"" and nothing changes. Recently they sent a tech out to my apartment. I'm unsure if he actually did anything because he just knocked on my door said my connection was good and asked me to do a survey for him. I have a suspicion that Comcast is intentionally lowering the speeds to encourage paying for a higher tier. I honestly wouldn't mind paying for a higher tier but I feel like something else is going on because I only get roughly 20% of the speed I pay for.

Is Comcast and Ajit Pai modern day book burners?Yes.,0
"Comcast refuses to provide my homes with internetHello, this is my first post and on mobile.

My family owns three homes and one business property all located next to each other on one road. We’ve been trying to get Comcast internet service for years, as they hold the monopoly in our township and the only other option is terrible satellite. In the past, around 2005 or so, they stated that they had no plans on coming out to our area any time in the future. This area included my road and two adjacent roads, around 20-30 houses total. 

Around a year ago, we found out that Comcast ran their lines to every house on all three roads except for our four properties. We’re about 500 feet from the nearest home that has internet, so we’re the only people on the road and surrounding area without service. I called and asked to set up service at our houses (our property showed as serviceable on their website).  They sent someone to do a site visit, where they came up with a price of $14,750 of which we would have to pay $8,500 to make our properties serviceable and claimed it would take 179 days worth of work. I asked my around the neighbors and none of them had to pay anything for any service and their homes hooked up in one day. 

I did some digging into the work they claimed needed done, which included having the power company raise a line on one pole, for $4,700, and to provide permits for Comcast, $3,000, to build on the poles. I called the power company who said this wasn’t true, nothing is wrong with their lines (they came and checked), they charge only $200 for permits, and they’ve never been contacted by Comcast so they are not sure why Comcast quoted this price or where they got their information. I have all of this in writing and voicemails from the power company. 

Of course I went back to Comcast with this and they are now refusing to ever provide our homes with internet, and again have “no plans to expand.”

Is there anything I can do about this? I tried reaching out to some of the executive contacts at Comcast but haven’t heard back. Even if I did pay Comcast’s price now, which I obviously can’t and most likely won’t ever afford, the power company wouldn’t come out and do work because they say there’s no work to be done. ",0

A couple years ago everyone was on about one that was over $200. I'm planning to upgrade to a 1GBps plan and I just need a modem that'll give me top speeds with that sort of connection as well as being compatible with Google Wi-Fi. Any recommendations, if not XB6? Thank you.",0
Can I get a static IP from comcast with out a business plan?,0
"Comcast Xfinity needs to tell people upfront about the ""Broadcast TV fee""I told Comcast all I wanted to use was internet. Comcast sold a package to me saying that it's internet, with a free TV perk. I asked the Comcast representative to clarify at least three times that there was no TV cost associated with accepting this deal. They say it's completely free, but I check my bill and there is a Broadcast TV Fee of about $13. It is outright deceptive not to mention this. Yes they probably mentioned it in the email agreement, but when the person employed by the company says there's no cost associated with it I felt like I could trust it. Fuck Comcast and their deceptive policies. ",0
Is it worth it to just ask for internet only? I don’t need phone and pretty much stream tv...,0
"Issues when downloading on gigabit planI'm having a strange issue, and i think it is from one of Comcast's peering points. When I download from varying sources, such as google drive, my personal dedicated server, OVH or other CDN networks. It's really easy to trigger, and I can set it off downloading a few gigabytes from any of the above mentioned sources.

To be clear, my internet connection does not drop just I lose access to major sections of it for a seemingly random period of time. When this occurs even sites such as Facebook become inaccessible, while Reddit still is.

&#x200B;

What I'm looking for is how to get this issue through to comcast as it is a major inconvenience. My guess is something along the route is detecting my legitimate traffic as an incoming DDOS (since I have gigabit download speeds)and nulls further traffic for some period of time. I'm attaching and example traceroute if that helps with anything.

"It's 2019. How bad is bufferbloat today?I'm running pfsense and traffic shaping is an absolute nightmare unless you have a phd in it.  I have a 250/20 connection and I can shape it to a max of about 150/16 until I can't get it to shape the download speed any higher.  If I remove traffic shaping I can get a higher speed but the dslreports bufferbloat test comes in at a 'c'-ish quality.  
  
I was wondering if bufferbloat is *really* an issue in 2019 or if it's something that we shouldn't worry about anymore.  In real life, what are the bufferbloat symptoms?

"I got scammed by xfinity.Here's my story. Last May 2018, we enrolled to Xfinity bundle deals of blast 150mbs + tv and we were paying $60 for it, they also give us an x1 box for ""free"", the lady said might as well give us one coz its free.

After 6 mos my bill was like 70$/month. Initially i thought maybe its the tax that's why I'm paying $10 more. It turns out they're billing me for that x1 box that I'm not even enrolled to, called them regarding that box and they told me that i need to add x1 to my plans to use it and pay more.

Also few months after may, xfinity started to email me that we already used our monthly data plans and whatever exceeds that will be $10/50gb so Sept 2018 i went to talked to xfinity and they told me if we want to eliminate the cap we need to enroll to unlimited data plans which is $50/month.
70+50=120
So i asked them about the gigabit plan, will it eliminate the data cap? The guy from Xfinity said yes and it'll cost us $122 like 2 dollars more. So i told them we'll take the upgrade. Since its almost the same. I confirmed it multiple times that we'll get 1000mbps + unli data. Then
Last month i was billed $168.

Today I went to xfinity and asked them why and told me that i exceeded their data cap. So it turns out its still there. I told them this is what i told, thats why i upgraded to gigabit. they only said to me that ""oh sorry we messed up.""
With this I'm moving to at&t!",0
"What is the record for faulty cable boxes before you got one to work?Hooking up new cable in my house and the box in my room booted up quick.  However, my roommate's box didnt work so i went to the store to replace it. Second box didnt even turn on when plugged in so i had to go back and even upgraded to the X1 box.  This box doesnt even get a signal.  I even plugged it into my room and the main room and it doesnt work so i know its not a problem with my roommates setup.

"Comcast Does Not Try To Retain People Anymore?I was a Comcast customer for 15+ years. I just switched to AT&T about a month ago.

&#x200B;

Every year or so, it was the same old song and dance.... Get some temporary deal, forget about it, price goes up, notice the increase (several months later than I should have), call back and get another temporary deal, rinse and repeat. 

&#x200B;

However, this year it was different. They wouldn't lower the price. They just keep trying to up-sell me (WTF?) with more channels for the same price. At one point, I told them I already had channels X, Y and Z, and they said ""well, you're not supposed to be getting those with your plan""... and, a few days later... POOF...all of those channels are gone. Do they think THAT is going to make me wanna stay? Even less channels for the same price that I'm already not happy with?

&#x200B;

I noticed that AT&T had a deal for 300Mbps fiber internet for \~40/month, so we decided to just cut the cable, go internet only, and use a streaming service (Youtube TV), with Roku.

&#x200B;

When I called Comcast before the switch (give them one more chance to convince me to stay), they wouldn't budge. Said some stuff about ""you won't really get 300Mbps"", etc. But heck, even if I get half of that, that's STILL faster than Comcast's speeds. But they wouldn't do anything about the price. So I switched.

&#x200B;

**Here's my main question. At this point, it's gotta be almost all profit for them. I had the boxes in my house already (which I'm sure that I've paid for 10X over by now) . I'd be just another subscriber, so virtually no cost for them? Why wouldn't they try to offer me some deal for like $50/month for 12 months to keep me from leaving???? Isn't SOME ($50) profit better than nothing??? Plus, once a customer has switched, it should be very difficult to get them back. I WON'T GO BACK, BTW. I also notice that a lot of co-workers are switching to AT&T as well. Does Comcast not care if they lose customers anymore? Just doesn't seem like they're trying.**

&#x200B;

BTW, I loathe Comcast. Always felt ripped off by them with their prices. One time they even started charging me for my own modem.""Oh yeah, we did an equipment audit, and didn't actually know who's modem it was, so we assumed it was ours and started charging you for it until you noticed. We'll take it off of  your bill, and only gave you a credit back to the start of the year."" WTF? Shady AF.

"In Seattle/Eastside area: Anyone getting 1Gb speeds with Gigabit package? (fastest i have achieved is around 480-500MbQuestion:

Is anyone in the Seattle, Eastside area able to consistently achieve Gigabit speed or close to it?

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Background:

Since signing up for Comcasts Gigabit service i have yet to achieve anything near 1Gb connection speed.

In the 30 bandwidth tests over the past 90 days the fastest achieved has been just under 500mb.

* [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) consistently reports the highest speed between 380 and 490Mb.
* Mlab consistently reports the slowest (averaging 250Mb)
* Comcast business speedtest reports about 300Mb
* [Speedtest.xfinity.com](https://Speedtest.xfinity.com) generally reports about 2/3rd the speed that [speedtest.com](https://speedtest.com)

&#x200B;

I have replaced the modem, changed location, tried different channels, etc.

I do not use wireless.

&#x200B;

Both modems reported low power on the end channels. It took a two hour call before being escalated to a department that recoginzied this as an issue.

Then a four call (in which three and half were spent repeating what i told the previous agent as i was punted to different departments) to get an agent to come in and test the connection.

Wire from pole to house was replaced.

&#x200B;

Still the fastest i get is 500mb.

Comcast is billing me for Gigabit package while providing midtier service.

&#x200B;

Sidenote:

Prior to Gigabit service we had not modified our account since ordering Business Class bleeding edge 50Mb connection speed a decade ago.

Over the years and without requesting it, comcast upgraded our speed to 250Mb. Our bill never changed...service was never interupted and latency was pretty low.

&#x200B;

A server i connect to in Florida regularly showed about a 60ms latency over the 50Mb connection speed.

Since upgrading to Gigabit that same connection now shows 140ms latency.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Anyway: anyone actually getting Gigabit speeds yet?

"DVR misbehavior, biggest issue is stuttering/pausing recording - helpWhen we set recordings, we always allow it to replace an old recording with the new and we tend to float near full (kids shows and such). Tonight, the first time in almost 2 years as a customer with the current equipment, the DVR chose to throw a ""storage full"" error instead of removing something old for something new. But the shows seemed to record anyway. Only, they hardly work.

The shows that recorded when full pause every couple of seconds, as if they're buffering. I tried a system refresh and that didn't resolve anything. Oddly, they seem to play fine via web browser or app on my phone but I haven't played them through there for more than a minute to fully confirm this.

The only thing I can think of that might have caused issues was yesterday the weather caused a few brown-outs with the power. I'm hoping the box isn't damaged. Signal still reads good though and no other problems seem to be showing.

---

I've been a satisfied Xfinity customer. I don't think it's amazing, but I've been perfectly fine with it. Until today.

I got a phone call from someone checking to see if I might want a new service package. I told him what I was interested in and he suggested a new package, but I asked if I'd still get TruTV (since it's probably about 50% of what I watch). The conversation went something like this:

> Rep: TruTV changed to Paramount Network. You will still get that.

> Me (skeptical): Wait, you mean like it changed names? That must have happened in like the last two weeks.

> Rep: It's been like that for a while but some of our grandfathered customers will still have TruTV in their channel lineup.

> Me: So all the content is the same? Like it's the same shows as TruTV?

> Rep: Yep, you'll still have all the same shows.

Well, I looked it up for myself afterward. I'm not sure whether he was mistaken or maliciously ignorant, but TruTV was not renamed to Paramount Network. Both still exist. They aren't even owned by the same company. I'm glad I didn't switch because I would have been *seething* if I didn't find out until it was too late to switch back.

It's frustrating when you're talking to a rep and they can't or won't give you the information you're looking for, but at least you can keep looking. There are few things that are more infuriating than when a rep actively provides the *wrong answer*. Once you eventually realize, there's little you can do besides accept that you got @#$%ed.",0

Data Caps for 500Mb and aboveYea yea another data cap thread....I really dont understand the logic behind offering higher speeds but still having a data cap.

"Long time victim, first time poster.I have had Comcast for about 5 years now. When I first signed up I was done with DSL (the only other option in my area) for it's utter un-reliability. I made the plunge with Comcast, and though the service (read: internet service) has been rock solid, the experiance as a customer has been... stereotypical.

When I signed up I grabbed myself a surfboard for $60 and enjoyed the speed. I have a custom set-up and I didn't want to fiddle with one of their modems to try to get unfiltered internet access. The bill hiked up several times over the next year and after checking it a few times I noticed there was a modem rental fee. I called in and asked about it, (about a 20 min  process) and the rep actually took it off and credited my account. Fairly simple, anyone can make a mistake right?

"Weird OutagesI have Comcast Business. Every few months the plant for my neighborhood just...goes wonky. For days at a time. It always goes the same way:

1. Upstream speeds grind to a halt. Often 0.2 Mbps if you can even get the upstream side of a speed test to complete. 

1. I call into Customer Support, do the modem reset and call back. Either by the time I call back I get an outage notice or the customer support rep confirms I'm call number 40 about the issue in my neighborhood. Sometimes a tech shows up the next day and only after _they_ get the run around do they finally figure out it's the entire neighborhood and a plant issue they can do nothing about.

1. Outage is marked (and appears) resolved in anywhere from 2 hours to the next day. Though one time it took a day to even admit there was an outage and another two days to fix it.

1. Several 1-2 hour outages continue to occur over the next few days to a week. These outages  are shown on the website and you get the ""there is an outage tech support can't help you"" message if you call in. 

1. All is well for about 2 or 3 months and then the whole process repeats again.

I also have deal offered for $90 for X1 Double Play that includes HD fee, but does not include DVR, broadcast, sport and tax fees that would be roughly $18-20 + $10 for DVR if I decided to add to it. So it would be total $110-120. Double Play has 140+ channels. Dunno if I would need DVR, since I think I would be content with On-Demand.

Instant TV  appeals to me with pricing and option to have skinny bundle with mostly local channels and optional premium networks. How good and reliable it is?

"I'm consistently getting less than 1/20th of the speed I pay for.This is has been going on for ages now, and it seems no matter what Comcast pretends to do, not a single competent person is able to help me. I have gigabit internet service with them, it is supposed to be (and advertised as) 1000Mbps down and around 40Mbps up. 

I regularly get, at most, 35Mbps down and about 30-40Mbps up. My modem is on the approved gigabit service list (ARRIS Surfboard SB8200 DOCSIS 3.1), and I'm running Cat5e directly into my gigabit router (ASUS RT-AC5300). I've absolutely had and am at the end of my rope. Every employee I talk to blames the other Comcast departments. 

I've had multiple techs visit my house and say there's problems but have claimed to fix them. It has never stuck. Everyone on the phone and chat have claimed to fix problems to no avail. Half the time an employee speaks to me they claim that my modem or router isn't supported or that Cat5e can't achieve gigabit speeds, or that I shouldn't use wireless when I'm literally on a wired connection. Some say Comcast doesn't even have a gigabit service. I can't help but feel that all of these kinds of people are either totally ill-informed or lying because they are lazy or don't want to deal with it. 

Any ideas here? I have no alternative where I live. I'm tired of paying for gigabit speeds but getting totally unacceptable and mediocre speeds that would have been ""high speed"" ten years ago. 

EDIT: Comcast ""outdoor wire"" techs came to look at the actual infrastructure outside my home...except, they never did come. My problems are the exact same and have not stopped at all. Here is a link to a screenshot of my signal levels from my router:

"Is it possible to achieve 5ghz wifi with a router upgrade?So today I was trying to set up a 5ghz network in my home, only to discover that my xfinity modem (model TEC TC8035c) only supports 2.4ghz. I've been using it in bridge mode with a netgear WGR614v10 router with the same limitation. 

My question is, if I were to upgrade my router to something newer like the n600, is that all I need to get a 5ghz network up and running, or will I still be limited by the modem, even with bridge mode enabled?",0
"This is your daily “fuck Comcast” reminderI’ve been doing the same dog and pony show with them for years now: Started my service with a decent price, promotion expires and my bill nearly doubled, I call and politely ask they reinstate my old price.

Until today?

My bill jumped from $50 to $81 but this time the best they could offer me was $65... even though new customers get the same deal for $45. Talked to three different people who all told me the exact same thing. 

So Century link will be here Saturday between 9 and 1. The difference is their prices are *for life*. Not sure the reasoning behind why you’d want to bait new customers only to hike their rates up but it seems counter intuitive.

"Sports cost charges from Comcast.I noticed on the bill there is a fee for the NFL and sport fees.  I don't watch sports.  So why am I paying for something I don't support?

I really do not care about the kneeling thing.  If the NFL needs some communist to kneel and hate the USA why do I care?   Can't he just move back to Cuba?  

I know some people that work at comcast.  He keeps going on facebook offering people free tickets to sporting events.  Really do you think I care about funding a slush fund for their execs to give away sporting event tickets?  

Comcast hidden costs and fees are just a load of crock.  Especially when they upped the box charges for new boxes when it seems to me there was nothing wrong with the old boxes.  

Then they took the old modem and gave me the new one.  Now my services is kind of spotty at best and slower than it was through the old modem.

If they update technology could not Comcast make sure they are actually giving better stuff than you already had?  Why give us crap?",0
ComassI’ve noticed that my mother has been going over her data cap for the last few months. She doesn’t do any hardcore online gaming no heavy movie downloads or big file transfers. She has a Ruko that streams Hulu and Netflix a few hours a day and YouTube from her cellphone. There is no way she should going over her data cap. I’ve never even came close to going over. My wife and I both worked full time from home and also spent the rest of the day online gaming on two different consoles and the same time. So to try to trouble shoot I switch her modem from the xfinity modem to a netgear gateway that I knew has a traffic meter on the modems interface. As of now 01/15/19 she has used 315 gb of data per the netgear traffic meter but Comcast’s data meter says she has used 638 gb this month. Something very fishy is going on ,0
"Anyone switch from comcast --> verizon??I'm a college student with 2 roommates.  When we moved to our townhouse, we got a decent price on a bundle from xfinity/comcast, high speed internet is obviously the most important thing for us since we spend most of our time studying around our laptops.   For the first year, our bill was at or about $77.  Then it hiked up to $97, now this month it went up ANOTHER $10.  We honestly never even use the cable/HBO since we just stream hulu/netflix (if we ever even have time for that).  Customer service was a joke and made no offers or explanation as to why the price keeps increasing.  

So i've done some research and it looks like verizon fios is in our area and is quoting me a significantly cheaper price - after installation fees it would be about $59 a month after the first 3 months.  I really only want internet alone, but it looks like the only option I can find with them is internet/phone. My concern is if they will also do ridiculous price hikes and add on ""fees"" that will end up being more than the $107 bill we had this month.  Anyone make the switch in the past and have any advice?

"Purchased service and installed modem, but can’t activate service?Spent all day dealing with this colossal pain in the ass of a company and I’m quite pissed off. Purchased basic internet (later found out that the rep signed me up for a 1 year contract and some bullshit stream service which I explicitly said I didn’t want) and was told that I needed to drop $70 to have a “professional” come out and set up my service because there’s never been service at this address. I explained to him that isn’t necessary, since my apartment has been prewired for Comcast (only service available here) and that my neighbors just went and picked up their modem and were up and running, so I was told that I could do the same. He still scheduled a tech to come out “just in case”. Picked up the modem and set it up, but I can’t activate the service because the XFi app says that “my gateway is on the way”. Well I’m looking at my goddamn gateway and I’d love to use the service that I’m paying for. Any ideas?

"Can not establish US/DS.So we used to have the old router with xfinity and we are also supposed to get around 120mbps. That router went to shit a couple weeks ago, so we called, had them send a “refresh signal” and it was still garbage. So, we then took the old router in and gave us a “new” 2.4/5GHz router that’s supposed to be “better” I did the setup and everything, as well as calling to have them activate it. It worked for the first day, then had a problem where it can’t establish a US/DS connection. Multiple refresh signals and power cycles on the router, and nothing works. We call to make an appointment, and the day before the appointment is scheduled, the router works perfect. Online is working and US/DS is good. So we cancel the appt. Now, a couple days later, it went to shit again and is stuck with US/DS flashing fast and online isn’t lit up at all. We made another appt. And then it’s been working for 2 days straight, with no problems. So we cancel again because we don’t want to deal with the fees they will tack on for no reason. And once again, it fails after we cancel. 

Any ideas? When we call, the robot support and as well as the human support, says the router shows them as being offline. 

I’m not sure what to do as nothing seems to help. 


EDIT: We do have some sort of amplifier that has cable going in, and cable going out, as well as being plugged in to the wall. Not sure if the router is supposed to have the connection of the outgoing? Or does it amplify all cable in the house? 

Also Edit, link of amplifier: https://imgur.com/a/jraSE61

EDIT #3: Tech just left, was a Comcast employee and he was really cool. Checked the amp (which is outside on the wall) he said at the tap it was melted. He said it could’ve been from our house having a bad ground and we are accidentally sending power back at the tap, or they might’ve done it by turning the power back on after the hurricanes or other possibilities like that. He set up a new amp, as well as the power adapter for the amp inside. Plus fixed the melting and wiring at the tap. Hopefully this will fix the issue. Haven’t had a problem all morning as of yet.

"2.4ghz speed dropped, while 5ghz stayed normal?My family has Xfinity with a router that supports 2.4 and 5ghz speeds. My computer's network adapter doesn't support 5ghz, so I'm always on 2.4.

"5GHz dropped out after declining an upsaleI'm going to preface this by saying that I don't have much technical knowledge, so if I'm off base/misunderstanding principles, please correct me. 

I was on support chat with Comcast yesterday because I missed a month's payment and they implemented a ""soft disconnect."" It was Christmas, I'm a teacher, I have two kids. Sometimes I roll a utility payment over to get through the month. I've never been disconnected before. 

Anyway, while on support chart - after having paid the past due balance to reconnect - I was offered an upsale that I was not interested in. I initially said I might be, but then after having the terms explained to me, I declined. It included an upgrade to a faster Internet speed, and the addition of cable. I don't care about cable and was only interested in the speed increase, but didn't think it was worth the cost. 

Today, every device in my house got kicked off the 5GHz band and we had to connect to the 2.4 band. Is this because I declined? I have never had to switch to the lower band on any device before and I've been using this network for over five years. Is Comcast pulling some shenanigans, or am I just an ignorant fool jumping to conclusions?

TLDR - I said no thank you to increased Internet speed and then lost access to the 5 GHz band on my router.  ",0
"Who thinks xFi WiFi Pods are ""Free"" if you need them? I'm not sure where this started, but that certainly was not the case for me.I had xFi installed a couple weeks ago, so far so good. I was already on gig, but am enjoying no data caps now.

I was under the impression (after several comments on this board) that the xFi pods would be provided if signal strength was not enough across my house, but this was certainly not the case. The tech did not carry them on the truck and was not informed that he even needed to test Wifi strength in my house. His recommendation was that I would need them though based off of my brick home and gateway living on one end of the house (as opposed to the middle).

Anyway, just felt like new subscribers to xFi shouldn't be under this impression. Not sure if this was a local promotion, but in Northeast FL at least the pods have to be purchased BY YOU even if you need them. I don't think you can even bill them to your account.

Of course, YMMV but just hoping someone else doesn't have false expectations like I did.

Bonus: ATT Gig was NOT available at my house until literally last week. Go figure. :D :D

UPDATE: Well I'll be damned, I got the email from Xfinity stating that I could benefit from pods, free to order online. Okay, I'll take them. :D It also said if you cancel Xfi within 90 days they will charge you the $119 for the 3-pack. ",0
"Comcast Triple Play - ARRIS Surfboard SB8200 - DOCSIS 3.1Just a note to anyone out there hoping to reach gig down with Comcast's Triple Play package.  Comcast is offering a service called Triple Play.  The service contains Internet at Gig, TV's, and a VOIP number/service.  As far as I can tell it is the ONLY service they have that offers Gig down, at least in my area.  Their double play and single play packages do not.

ARRIS Surfboard SB8200 is a DOCSIS 3.1 certified router that supports gig down (one of only a couple).  It is certified to work with Comcast and works on Comcast's double and single play packages.

However, you can not buy Comcast's Triple Play and use the ARRIS Surfboard SB8200 to reach the gig down speeds since the ARRIS Surfboard does not have VOIP ports and Comcast's activation process will not let it activate.  Further, there are no commercially available DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems that have VOIP ports on the market.

**Translation**:  If you want Gig down you MUST use Comcast's router/gateway.

I think this is pretty deceptive on both parties.  ARRIS does not work with Comcast's gig down service, despite the marketing materials indicating it will.  Comcast does not allow custom gateways (since none are available and those that are they blacklist).",0
"Help, which box for HD w/o internet?Hi, I’m trying to upgrade my mother’s legacy basic cable SD service to HD and bring her into the modern age.... Comcast Xfinity has thrown us into a rabbit hole of days talking with tech, repair visits, etc.

What box should we be requesting that will allow auto-tuning to HD channels without Comcast internet? 

Current problem: they gave us a DTA box, HD channels look pixelated, and they’re only available on channel selection 700+. SD channels have black bars on tops and bottom, not full screen.

"High Loaded Latency on Hardwired Connection (w/ 400mbps)Just moved to a new apartment. I have recently started streaming on Twitch 5 nights a week, so a fast and stable connection is very important to me. I purchased 400 MBPS service, and it came with theire XB6 gateway. My up and downstreams have both been great, and my unloaded latency has averaged about 14ms. Unfortunately, my loaded latency has been hovering between 150-900ms for a week now, even when I have my desktop as the only active device connected to internet.

&#x200B;

I thought maybe it was the gateway, so I purchased a new modem and a new router. My bandwidth slightly increased, but the latency issues remained. I have tried a new ethernet cable, and wi-fi connections, and it's consistently high, though the number fluctuates wildly. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday, an Xfinity tech came out and identified it as a ""flux"" problem to my connection from the main end outside, and said it required the attention of a maintenance tech, which could take up to a month to get out. I'm not trying to wait a month, and am curious what else I could do on my end.

&#x200B;

I complained about this on Twitter and @ComcastCares DM'd me. They are sending another service tech out Tuesday, just like the one who came yesterday, likely to tell me the same thing the one yesterday told me.

&#x200B;

Is it possible that downgrading my bandwidth could decrease my latency, as it essentially means traveling with a smaller load? Seems counter-intuitive, but almost dumb enough that it could work. At this point, I would be happy with anything consistently below 100, as I have never seen less than 128 since I moved in a week ago. I am starting to think it really is a ""flux"" problem, as described by the tech, though I really don't know what that means. Anyone got any ideas?!",0

"Saw a $2 increase in Broadcast TV fee...Having had past experience with Comcast, this is exactly the sort of thing that I find infuriating. 

First customer service rep sounded like she hates comcast as much as any of us here. I asked simply if I should expect random increases to my bill. She replied that I should have received notice on my bill and commiserated that no such notice was provided. She apologized but seemed thoroughly disenfranchised. I asked to speak with a supervisor.

The supervisor eventually joined the line. She directed me to the fourth page of my bill, which suggests...

""Broadcast network fees look to recover a portion of the increasing costs from local programmers. These are not government mandated or required fees and will increase from time to time.""

I asked if I should expect random increases. She said no, that this isn't random, that it is noted on my bill.

This is literally on every bill. Therefore, yes, I should expect random changes.

Done venting. Thanks to this community for helping me see their usual playbook. You all helped me remember to get a receipt for the return of my last cable box. It was very helpful to have documentation in hand. Even with that, I spent a month trying to get a lost equipment charge off of my bill.

They have cornered the market in 95% of the Greater Houston area, and will file lawsuits just to hang up any other legitimate competitor, because they have more money.

Fuck it all, down with Comcast.

So if I'm not supposed to have a data cap since I have the gigabit internet, why does my internet always crap out once I reach 1TB? I go through a specific person every call when I talk about my plan, since it is through my landlord's company discount. I was told no cap, and even if there was, I would never be able to reach it with just three people. Especially three people that work 40 hours a week, sometimes more.

"Upgrade broke my Internet&#x200B;

I've been a customer of Comcast since 2007 and after my last agreement ended, my bill jumped to $242.00 per month. I agreed to a new 2 year contract that would boost my speed to 250 mbps and give me a few channels I wasn't getting with the old plan. The representative told me my old modem would not suffice for the higher speeds so I also had to agree to a new modem and install kit (scam #1 -  this $15.00 kit includes the new modem and the same cables I already had) as well as paying another $15.00 for the shipping of the new modem. They had an issue shipping my new modem so  my service was upgraded 5 days before it got here. 2 days ago I ran a speedtest on the old modem and was getting 245 mbps but I went ahead and switched to the new modem anyway since I had to pay for it. 

&#x200B;

After installing the new modem I ran a speedtest and was shocked to see I am now getting 43 mbps download speed. The first tech I spoke to ran a bunch of tests and signal refreshes and after telling him my service was just fine with the old modem he suggested I just switch back to it since nothing was working for the new modem. After I switch back, the old modem no longer has connectivity because I had to register and activate the new one. The 2nd tech was able to re-activate the old modem but now the highest speed I can get on it is 44.4 mbps. $207.00 per month for downloads in the low 40's...

&#x200B;

Now both techs were very nice but after a combined 3 hours of connecting, reconnecting, sending signals, unplugging and loosening and tightening the same cables over and over again, we've come to the conclusion that I need to contact a different department about my problems between the hours of 9-5 m-f and if they can't fix the issue then I will have to schedule a tech to come out and fix what was working just fine the night before I got the new modem that I apparently didn't need in the 1st place. Upon doing some searches, I see that Comcast is just using contract renewals as a way to get addon charges for new equipment/shipping as well as using your new modem as a ""hotspot"" by default. 

&#x200B;

As a longtime customer already feeling screwed by the fact that new customers who have shown no loyalty to a company, get better deals than I am given, this is the only way they can push me closer to making a switch to a new provider. I wasted 3 hours tonight and my service is worse than its ever been. On top of that, I have no chance of getting it fixed without taking time off of work to make more phone calls and/or meet a home technician. I was told I would be getting a $20.00 credit for my troubles though.....",0

"Chicago - Help me reduce my parents Comcast bill from $300!I'm looking at my parents comcast bill and trying to help them reduce monthly costs.  Before you say get rid of phone, or cut the cord, know that won't be happening.  However, I would like to get the cost down on the existing menu of services.

I see I can reduce the monthly fee on [comcast.com](https://comcast.com) by ""signing up for a new offer"" to reduce the base monthly charge to $139 per month if I sign a 24 month commit, or to $149 for 12 months if I sign a 0 month commit.  Of course, both require me to upgrade from Preferred to Preferred Plus on the TV lineup (220 vs 230 channels), of which I'm sure this difference is negligible.  So negligible there is no difference showing on the channel comparison tool between the two plans.  Certainly, this was also be designed to get you to upgrade so charges are more after the 12/14 months, I'm sure.  My parents are also moving out of state in 16 months, so I""m not sure if that's a valid reason for cancelling the 24 month contract or not.

&#x200B;

Digging deeper into this bill, many of the charges are for adapters, rental fees, and other accessory services.  It's a large house with many people and the base rate can only help so much with this.   Buying the internet modem is probably an easy win, but are there any avenues to reduce the rental fees?  Are there any equipment ""bundles""?  Can you purchase the equipment?

&#x200B;

Finally, there's always the option of getting a quote from DirectTV and seeing is Comcast will match, but let's save that option for last.

"New place is strangely wired, trying to get MoCA to work and assessing optionsSo I recently moved into a new place where I can get Comcast xfinity service.  My modem-router is set up in the living room and is working great for all devices connected via wired or wi-fi. The source of this post is coming from one major issue I am having: My PC is located in an office a good distance from the modem-router, and I want it to have a wired connection.

When I scoped the place out I saw there was a coaxial in the office area. From some research I found out there are these things called [MoCA Adapters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077Y3SQXR?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b10&pf_rd_r=VWC44JRJB0431VS280NR) I can use to run internet over the coaxial cabling in a household without having to get two modems or anything. Great, this way I can set up my gaming consoles in the living room with the modem-router and the PCs in the office with MoCa adapter, everything can be hardwired and I don't have to run a giant ethernet cable from the living room the office creating a trip hazard all around.

Tech comes out, sets up the modem-router (An XB3, if curious). It has MoCA-capability on it, meaning the modem is already equipped with the ability to 'share' the internet connection over the home coaxial network. Even better. I turn this function on from the router's page, set up my MoCA adapter, connect it to my PC and get ready to tango.

No dice.

The adapter receives power and ethernet connection, but the little light that shows it has a live MoCA connection over the coaxial is dead. I try the coax port in the bedroom (Which is next to the office) and get the same result. I try moving the modem-router to the office and connecting it to the coaxial. No internet.

I call comcast and walk them through this, I have a helpful customer service rep who concludes the coaxial wiring in these other rooms must not be connected to the comcast line in the living room or are faulty somehow. Schedules a tech to come out this week.

Here's where I need to get advice. My understanding is that comcast techs generally charge money for their time. The customer service rep didn't quote me anything but said the tech would have to assess and determine something. I already paid $80 for a tech to come out and install the modem, had I known this would've been an issue I would've absolutely asked that the modem be set up in the office instead of the living room since it's more important for my PCs to have a hardwired ethernet connection. From my perspective this is work that should have been done as part of installation and I should not have to pay more for it.

I don't know how a comcast tech will see this, but I know that my laptop is getting 150 mbps on wireless and almost 300 mbps when connected directly to the modem. My PC does not get this much at all, but I think that's because the wireless card is ancient (10+ years old).

So it's basically pay for a new wireless card (relatively cheap) and see if I can game decently on 150 mbps wireless or see how much a tech wants to unfuck the cabling the situation that should have been unfucked as part of installation. Is there any third option i'm not seeing (besides a ridiculously long ethernet wire from the living room to the office) that anyone could recommend, or ways I could make my case to comcast that this should be done at no additional cost?",0
"Question(s) before attempting to switch to xfinityI’ve been with at&t since they came out with dsl, for a verrryyy long time.

I get about 6mb MAX download and you can forget about upload but the ping is amazing. Being an avid online gamer and streamer, it’s either one or the other, not at the same time. 
 
I wanted to switch to xfinity because I know a lot of people who say they love it down here in my area and according to my neighbor he friggin loves it but I didn’t get a chance to ask him about installation etc. ive done a lot of reading about technicians coming out and surveying, determining a quote and how much material and so on. I know there is a greenish box by the road of my house maybe 100-200 feet from my home and haven’t seen one in my neighbors yard I don’t believe in which I believe this is what cable companies use to install service to..?(not a 100% on that) 

How much does xfinity or Comcast charge to install/run/bury a line for just internet, I’ve also read where you can have the line ran overhead as well instead of burying if I’m not mistaken.

"Required to activate equipment on a daily basis... help!Long story short: the box at the curb has 2 jacks in it.  One goes to my house... one goes to the neighbor. **Are the ports in that box addressable?**

Issue: The cables in that box got switched.  Mine was in port A... my neighbors was in port B... now, mine is in B and his is in A.  Ever since that happened, on a daily basis I am prompted to log in and verify my username/password with comcast to ""activate my equipment"" in order to get on the internet. TV has no issues.

"Wrong name on my accountHave had an absolutely shitastic experience with Xfinity Mobile. My home internet service is in my name, so when I opened my Xfinity Mobile account I presumed it would also be in my name. Seems logical, right? Nope. They put it in my ex-husband's name (who, btw, has had nothing to do with the xfinity accounts for over a year!) 

The first time I called I was told it was a glitch that they were working on. To check back in a few days. So I did. Account still in his name. Called again and was told to sign off on every device, delete the app, change my username and password, reinstall app and it would be fixed. NOPE. Called back, went through this whole story AGAIN with an xifinity mobile customer service dude who, after 20 minutes of putting me on hold, told me I'd have to call Comcast to get it changed because he didn't have the ability to change such things. 

So, I called Comcast. Spoke to one person who couldn't help me, she transferred me to another person who also put me on hold for endless minutes only to tell me that she was going to transfer me to THE RIGHT DEPARTMENT! WHAT?! My call was transferred and I'm on hold. Expected hold time? 2.5-3.5 HOURS! HOURS!!!! And they have no service to leave your number and they'll call you back or any of that.

"Comcast stores WiFi passwords in plain text, and exchanged modems' passwords are visible to the new owner before registering the modem.Obviously this only applies to rented comcast modems, but if you get a modem from comcast that was previously owned, the network name and WiFi password from the last owner is visible to you on the xFi section of their website prior to you hooking up and registering the modem to your account. Of course, this information is also stored in plain text.

So if you've ever returned a modem, congratulations, there's a possibility someone has your old password. Hopefully it's not a password you've used elsewhere, and your network name doesn't give up more information about you or your account.

"Just signed up for Comcast - Switched from AT&T... Fees are piling up... Need advice!Hello,

I have used Comcast for 2 years prior to Jan 2018. I switched to AT&T + DirecTV for gigabit and to try out satellite TV. I hated it. 

We switched back as DirecTV was going up to $125/month and internet was $80/month. I don't watch TV.. I stream everything. My sister and I split the bill and she watches TV and prefers to have a set top box.

I signed up on bf and was [told this.](https://i.imgur.com/tDbVapy.jpg) However, [these are my charges... ](https://i.imgur.com/mKMc8Gj.jpg) As you can see, the bill is $5/month more.

I was not told that the starter double play was SD TV with an HD box so you can 'stream HD movies'. So I turn on the TV for the first time 2 days after it was installed and there are weird boxes on my 55"" 4k TV. I call them up and they tell me HD is $10/mo more. I'm like ok whatever... At least now those boxes will go away.

This is now $15/mo more than what I was told.

Today, I go to record a few shows as I hate commercials and refuse to watch TV live... (That and my ADHD doesn't let me sit through commercials very often) I find out the set top box we have is NOT a DVR... For that it is ANOTHER $10/mo more than what was advertised.

I don't watch TV unless it is recorded or online. So, I have finally gotten my sister to a point where she is okay with streaming instead of the set top box... So I ask how much is Internet only.

They tell me 150mbps is $79.99/mo and 60mbps is $49.99/mo.. to stream on 4k TV's and phones we need 150mbps minimum. It is 2 college students and myself (a recent graduate) using the internet if my family doesn't come down to visit. That is 2 TVs, 3 Phones, 1 Desktop, and 2 Laptops online... Not including my iPad or my family's equipment when they come to visit.

I'm saying this all to ask **tl;Dr** Does anyone know if retentions can offer me a better deal? What about a store? My boyfriend told me his aunt just signed up and got 250mbps for $75/mo which we would get in a heartbeat. I live in 32246 zip code if you want to help me look.

"Comcast ripped me off but I was saved by DiscoverI hope this post helps someone who is in a similar situation as myself.  I got out of my contract early by moving to a city they don't service...with some hiccups.

Story:

I had less than a year left in my contract and was moving to a new city.  The city I was moving to did not have Comcast and I was free to get out of my contract **IF** I gave Comcast proof of my new residency.  

I called Comcast July 2018 and gave them 30 days notice explaining the situation. They pulled up the zip code and verified service did not exist in my area.  I signed a document stating that I have 60 days to prove that I moved or I would owe $1081.11

On July 31, I terminated the services with Comcast and the 60 days began.

On August 1st, I moved to the new city and began quickly setting up utilities (this took a minimum of 30 days to get a statement).

Just 20 days later I receive an automatic charge to my credit card for the early termination fee (you should change your credit cards so this doesn't happen to you).

[Comcast Charging Me Early](https://i.redd.it/xz5ajlvwrz221.png)

Angrily, I call Comcast and explain that I'm still gathering the Utility Bills to prove that I moved.  I stated my 60 days are not over and it was unfair they were already charging me the early termination fee.  The representative stated to quickly email in the documents and everything would be resolved.

I spent a total of 4 hours on the phone with 5 representatives (including supervisors!).  Every single representative had a different story.  I did get through to one who told me it was unfair and he took my case personally opening a claim (which I never heard from again).

By now, it's September and I have already emailed all the proof that I moved to a new location.  I have paid the $1081 early termination fee on my Discover credit card to avoid finance charges.

I called and spoke to a representative who told me my **refund** check was in the mail!  ""Thank God, what a relief it's over.""

More weeks pass and...

I call back end of September,  ""Where's my check?"" I finally get a representative to tell me my case is closed!  There is no check and she laughs ""we don't do checks"".  Comcast closed my case without me knowing and the early termination fee will not be refunded.

By now I am raging.  No one at Comcast will listen to my story.  The 60 days have expired.  I have done everything they asked me to do.

I call Discover cards and explained my story.  I report Comcast as FRAUD and Discover gave Comcast 60 days to respond.  I had to upload all the proof again and write out my statement. Silence for 60 days!  I won and got **all my money back** because Discover assisted me!

From beginning to end it took nearly 4 months and guess what?  I'm currently a Spectrum customer....which is...Comcast.  Change your policy Comcast!!!

I posted here once before and the advice given didn't solve my problem, so I'm back.

My network has been unavailable for 5-6 weeks now, both on wifi and connecting via ethernet (to router or modem). I've been using the xfinitywifi hotspot during that time. It was suggested that I replace my equipment (3rd party router and modem), so I did, and even with the brand new equipment, I have no access via wifi or ethernet. I've had xfinity techs come out twice, the first time they blamed it on the router (before the new one) the second time they blamed it on the modem (this was with the new one). When they leave, I can always connect via ethernet to the modem, but within a day or two, I lose that ability. 

I then spent 90 minutes with tech support with the router company, and we tried everything she had available to alter it from there as well. She said she thought the connection was unstable, as Xfinity says the connection is reaching my apartment. I'm genuinely at my wit's end. Please, somebody actually fix my internet.",0

We assumed he had closed the ticket or whatever and scheduled for the Post Wire appointment and that they need to communicate with the rental office of my apartment complex for the appointment to take place. Not a problem because I can use the “Xfinity WiFi” public hotspot right. 

Wrong. After using the hotspot up til November 20th we suddenly are unable to use it anymore. We had been using it for Netflix as well as our Xbox One gaming.  Now I’m royally pissed. Representives are useless telling me I should be able to still use it etc and why don’t I use my personal one -_-. 


After several attempts to contact Comcast and my rental office on November 23rd I have yet another tech come out to tell me the same thing that technician on the 2nd said. This tech tells me and my husband that the first tech never put in that it needed a post wire let alone contacting the rental office. The first tech told us that they needed permission from the rental office to do the work on the street. Frustrated my roommate calls the rental office on Sunday and they proceed to tell her that Comcast doesn’t need to have their approval to do the work. 

I schedule the Post Wire appointment for November 28th. I requested that I be off for this day so that I could make sure everything is functioning.  The appointment window was 9 am to 12pm. I check my XFINITY app to see if the appointment is in there and it’s not. It’s 12:30pm. No phone call nothing. I call customer service. The first person tells me the tech is 20-30 minutes away. I wait 1 hour. No tech. I call again. The second rep tells me they have anywhere between 8 am to 8 pm to complete the post Wire but that the rep will contact me when they have an ETA for the rep. No call within the hour. I call a 3rd time same thing. Within 20 minutes after getting off with the 3rd rep (at this point it is 4:00) the tech calls my phone and says they are 45 minutes away. 

The tech asks me where the lines are. Frustrated I tell him the same things I repeated consistently over the month. He looks at the main line tested it. He asks me if there is a main line box. I said I don’t know. All I know is that there is work supposed to be done outside to run it up here. He goes outside. After a few minutes he comes back and says that he needs to have access to the apartments below me (both of which are vacant) to run the wire up to my apartment (we are on the 3rd floor). I contact the rental office. They say that they can’t allow Comcast inside the two apartments below to do the work. I tell the tech and he calls the rental office himself. They say the same thing. 

Now it is December 1st. I still have no internet. The rental office for some reason or another won’t let them do it and another billing cycle has came. I haven’t paid rent yet as I don’t get paid til the 7th. 

My question is if Comcast has issues with Post wire or whatever can I just switch to Verizon without a tech having an issue? I don’t want cable just internet. 

If not any solutions here?  Much appreciated. I’m pretty much wanting to cancel Comcast but I need internet though ",0

"has anyone ever taken a look at their modem config file to see if comcast is setting speeds according to what you pay for? or maybe they're lower?(solved? not a tech issue but a greed issue see update at bottom) 

i ask this because for the 2 unfortunate years i've been an xfinity customer my dl speeds are always under half of what my plan advertised. when i paid for 100mbps i got around 40mbps. now i have a 60mbps plan and it's hideously slow. speed test results: fast .com says 15mbps while xfinity says 27mbs.

i own my modem, an sb6183.

they're sending a tech out (again) next week and i'm also wondering if the comcast owned modem the tech brings to test the line might have a config file with higher speeds. anyone know for sure if i'm right to be suspicious?


p.s. if you've come to this thread to try to convince me that comcast is not a monopoly or that isps do not behave like a cartel, save your time and just don't.

*** update: so here's what went down: after the 2 years of paying for 100 just to get 50 because they said i couldn't get 50 in my area (huh? was able to get 50 when paying for double)

to lower my bill, comcast on twitter sold me 60mbps but it turned out to be 25mbs. 

bought a new sb6183, new cat6 cables, no wifi, computer direct to modem and the results were exactly the same. it WAS the config file as i had suspected. my speeds were completely due to comcast ripping me off and my equipment was fine.

last phone rep said in my state i can only get 25 or 100 (real 100 doesn't exist locally so that's not true) nothing in between and twitter comcast should never have sold me the 60.

went back to twitter comcast and they checked and said they made a mistake but i could get blast for my state at 50mbps, but that my state has different speeds, prices and plans from the rest of the country and that's why the 60 they sold me was less than half that.

for now i took the blast at 50 for half of what i was paying before but i am exploring the only other alternative at my address which is centurylink. i just found out that there might be a possibility of up to 40mbps via business dsl (on their residential website it said 12 was the fastest, not sure if i trust the 40 claim).

centurylink is just as hated here as comcast so i'm not sure what i will do eventually. may have to set up dsl too and just jump between bad isps to keep from being robbed by comcast in the future.

btw, speeds are now matching the plan i agreed to. this whole thing was never a tech problem and never was, it all had to do with price/speed/availablity comcast capriciously assigned to my state and the fact that 100 calls, visits etc produce an equal number of conflicting diagnoses that have nothing to do with the actual situation.

i've spent my entire week on this and tbh my outlook on this whole situation is very bleak.

"Comcast Wants Me To Switch From Legacy BoxesI got a call from Comcast today. They were insisting that I switch 2 of my legacy cable boxes to X1. I've been hanging onto them because they get the job done. I'm no luddite by any means and i think the X1 is pretty cool, but the legacy boxes are simple and they ""just work"". I've also been told by a technician that the X1 boxes are much more sensitive to the cable signal, which makes them more prone to freezing, whereas the legacy boxes just passively decode a video signal. 

Is it *really* worth switching to X1 boxes? I have an amp and a few splitters so i don't know if they'd play nice with X1. I'm just afraid that if i switched over to X1 boxes and i have a bad experience, i wouldn't be allowed to have my legacy boxes back. ",0

"Comcast is saying we’ve used 1TB of data this monthI guess I’m looking for some advice and/or confirmation of what I think is happening. I just got a 90% usage alert from Xfinity yesterday - they say we’ve used 973Gb of data this month. This struck me as really odd, as, 

(1) last year, when they capped everyone’s Internet to 1TB, I checked our usage and we averaged between 300-500Gb every month when it was just me and my partner; we did get a roommate in February, but all he does is stream Hulu for a few hours when he’s home;

(2) after this alert, I checked our last few months of usage, and there’s what I consider a very suspicious 200Gb increase every month since August: Aug was 328Gb, Sep was 556Gb, Oct was 732Gb and, now a week from the end of our bill, Nov is 973Gb; if someone were hacking our WiFi, an almost exact 200Gb exponential increase is still off; 

(3) we have made no drastic changes since August in devices or our uses: we have 3 xboxes altogether (upgraded to an Xbox X last weekend), a Nintendo Switch and (as of last week) a new Qled tv; at most, there’s typically only 2 consoles in use at the same time; we download maybe one game every other month or so, and while there were new downloads with the new tv and Xbox, those were in the past few days and don’t justify the suspicious 200Gb increase every month. 

(4) we are three full-time working adults; we play some multiplayer videogames and we stream online shows. Nothing is on constantly and we’re out of the house for 50-60 hours each every week. 

5) when I called tech support at Xfinity and asked how on earth we were close to our max, the tech told me my phone might be constantly backing up photos to the cloud. A TB’s worth?? 


My question is: is Xfinity skewering their numbers so that they can start charging people for over a TB of data? Am I wrong, and could we possibly be using that much data in a month? We do have our consoles on the quick start mode (sort of like sleep mode), but they shouldn’t be downloading anything while it’s off. The three of us have smartphones, but none of us are what you’d call heavy users of them: we google, Reddit, and Spotify for the most part.

Things we’ve done: 

1- We bought a new modem/router (NETGEAR Ac1900) last night, and will be using that plus maybe some apps to track our own usage. We will be returning the rental from xfinity.

2-we changed our WiFi password; 

3-I’m thinking of reporting this to the FCC, as I suspect it’s a shady practice.

"Comcast cut the cord for me! And thank you for doing what I wasn't ready to do.Former comcast customer, went to directv (sat) for a year, and now that we're moving to a new house, decided to go back to comcast since I have a massive tivo setup. Made the appointment, told Comcast I needed two cable cards for my two tivos.

Decided to get the triple play, with internet and home security. Guy calls 15 minutes before the installation appointment to see if I could be early. Couldn't get there early but I asked him if made sure to bring two cable cards.

""What cable cards?"", he asked.

""The ones I made sure that the lady who took my order put on the install order"", I said.

""Oh, yeah, it's here, but they don't give us cable cards""

""But it's on the order ..."", I said.

""Well they don't give technicians the cards""

""OK,"" I said, ""just come install the internet and I'll have the cable installed later"".

""No can do, have to do the full order, or nothing""

""But I took the day off from work ...""

""Can't do it"" and he hung up on me.

Great start Comcast. I call up customer service, infuriated. They confirm that they don't give cable cards to technicians and I have to pick them up myself. Noted to the very nice lady that it would have been nice if they told that to me the first time. Or maybe if anyone had read the friggin order.

No worries, she told me that my local Xfinity store had the card and even though the technician had bounced my install for a week, she could arrange for installation on the next day. Just go pick up you cable cards and be ready tomorrow morning!

I dutifully went to the Xfinity store. ""We don't carry cable cards anymore, they have to send them to you."" ""But the phone service lady said you have them in stock"". ""We don't carry them anymore""

So I call Comcast to see if they can overnight them to me so I'd have them for tomorrow's appointment. ""No we can't, and you don't have an appointment tomorrow, it's next Monday. Anyway, go to your local Xfinity store they have them in stock."" ""No,"" I said, ""I'm calling from outside the store - they don't have them anymore"". ""But the computer says they do."" ""No ma'am,"" I said, ""I assure you they don't ... would you like me to walk back and have them tell you?""

""No,"" she said, ""I can have them with the technician at your monday install."" ""Are you sure?"", I asked, ""the last consumer rep said they weren't allowed to carry them."" ""Oh, no,"" she said, ""I just have to make sure they're on the order"". Fine, I and my family will wait until Monday.

Monday morning comes, another day off work, and the technicians show on time. ""No sir, we don't have cable cards, we're not allowed, you have to get them at the Xfinity store."" Again, I tell them that they don't carry them. ""Can you just install the internet?"" ""No sir, we have to put in the full order.""

""Wait, what if I have you cancel the triple play, and just move to the internet alone?"" ""Let me call my supervisor"" We wait, supervisor says it's fine. They very nicely install just my internet.

Do quick research, find that PSVue has built in DVR (a must for my wife). Go buy 4 fire sticks. Install the PSVue on each. Very happy family

Thank you Comcast, I may never have cut the cord on my own, but your insistent incompetence, and the suggestion from your own people, got me to do it. Couldn't be happier. Just can't wait until I can get high speed internet from someone other than you - you don't deserve to be in business.

"Is Comcast deliberately charging you for modem that you own too?I've owned my own Comcast modem for 8 years now after renting their modem for a year. However, the transition hasn't been smooth. After first year, they charged me for the modem that I returned back to them, claiming I never returned. When I asked them I had returned their modem a year ago, they asked for a receipt, which I didn't have after a year. So I got overcharged. However, that wasn't the end. Since then once in a while they start charging me $10 for modem rental for the modem that I purchased by myself. I have auto payment setup, but I still check my billing statements. When I call them back, they tell me that's a glitch on their system and refund me the money. However, this thing keeps happening again and again. They have done that twice in past 3 months now. Last time I talked to them, their representative wasn't aware of the problem and it took them an hour to resolve my issue. I really hate spending my time dealing with Comcast customer service. Unfortunately, because of their monopoly, I have to use their service.

&#x200B;

Since this has been occurring very frequently for many years, I have come to the conclusion that they are doing this criminal practice on purpose. So that they can increase their revenue by a good margin, by charging extra from customers that own a modem. I'm pretty sure not all those customers with auto payment check their billing statements. I highly doubt it's a software glitch, because it hasn't been resolved for years.

Can't do it online because every page I go to pertaining to moving services only tells me ""Congratulations, Comcast is available at that address"" and gives me a number to call.

I called in this morning to try and get it sorted. What followed was a conversation where the rep said I had to be signed up for a completely new service.

"Comcast wants me to pay $7000+ to have cable ran to my house.I am located in GA and me and my wife just moved in to our newly constructed home. When I checked availability of internet service to the new address, Comcast's website said that service was available. 

About three weeks ago I scheduled for Comcast to come out hook up cable to the house as we would be moving in soon. The tech arrives to our location and instantly says he can't do the job, that the construction department needs to come out and run cable to the house. He also told us that this will likely be expensive and that someone will call us to schedule a visit. After about a week of waiting we contact Comcast again and say no one has contacted us and that we need to have cable run to the new house. The representative on the phone says no problem and schedules the appointment. During this phone call we ask them about pricing and that the previous technician said it would be expensive. The representative on the phone assures us that this is wrong and we won't be charged anything other than the one time installation fee. 

The appointment day comes and another tech shows up and tells us that he cannot do the job that we don't have wires run to the house. We explain to him that we discussed this at length with the representative on the phone. This tech again tells us we need to contact the construction department. At this point my wife goes up to the physical Comcast building and ask to speak to the construction manager. She is informed that he is not in the office in the afternoon and the receptionist supposedly emailed him to contact us the next day. 

Two days go by and again no contact from Comcast. My wife emails the receptionist and gives her both our phone numbers and both of our email addresses. Again no contact. My wife then goes up there today and the receptionist tells her that they have been trying to contact me all week. This is a lie as I have no voice mails or emails from them. It is possible they called while I was at work during which time my phone is off but still they didn't leave any messages. The construction manager tells her that to install lines to our house it will cost $7000+ and there is no payment plan options available. 

For reference my neighbors have Comcast internet and the street connection is currently at the end of my driveway. I do have a pretty long driveway, I am about 800 ft from the road while most of my neighbors live close to the street. There are also already poles running down my driveway for electricity to be supplied to my house. I could understand if we had to pay money for an electrician to run cable from the box on the street to my house but I think over $7000 is very excessive. Mostly this just a rant but if anyone has any suggestions I would be very open to hearing them.",0
"How to stop harassing unused equipment calls???Hello everyone,

* I had Comcast for about 4 years while I lived in my apartment near my university.

* I am no longer a Comcast/Xfinity customer.

* When I signed up and had the guy install everything, and he told me that when I move out I should simply leave my equipment at the apartment.

*  I don't know if this is an important detail, but about 2 years in my apartment complex was bought by another company.

Anyways, I canceled the service when I moved out in July. About a 3 weeks after I started getting spammed with about 5-6 calls a day from spoofed phone numbers requesting that I return my unused equipment. My online account shows nothing owed, and I have not received anything in the mail about this. 

One time I answered the phone and there was someone obviously in India named ""Eric"" on the other side. I explained exactly what I just said here: that I moved out and was instructed to leave the equipment in the apartment. ""Eric"" said that was just fine and that no more action was needed on my part. 

About a week past and then they started up again, using different spoofed numbers. The number of calls also increased. I read somewhere that Comcast contracts this out to collectors, and what I think may be happening is that these fuckers just re-sold a list containing my name to make money. 

Who can I speak to in order to make this shit stop? It's not affecting my credit since I don't owe anything, but it's really fucking annoying as I am job searching at the moment and I sometimes can't tell if its a legit number or if I am getting a callback from the hundreds of jobs I am applying to. 

I'm afraid that if I just talk to them again, the same shit will happen and escalate.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Tl;dr: I don't owe anything, am getting a harassing number of phone calls from fake numbers, what do I do?

My previous Comcast promotion ran out a few months back but work/life have kept me from the whole idiotic process of redoing it.

"Can't Access Certain WebsitesHello,

Recently I got a new router from Comcast after my old one started to sporadically cut off internet access and ever since then I have been plagued with the Xfinity Activation screen whenever I access some websites.

For example, if I go on [Camopedia.org](https://Camopedia.org) (yes I like looking at different camo designs) I am prompted with the black Xfinity Activation screen as if I never activated my service before, which I had to do because I wouldn't be able to make this Reddit post from my own home without it. To be more specific the page I'm directed to is this one: [https://register.be.xfinity.com/activate](https://register.be.xfinity.com/activate) and before I could just do the activation over and over again to access that page but eventually it told me: ""Sorry, we can't find this device."" and now I'm left without access to the more obscure parts of the internet and what worries me is that if I come across a problem and need a quick solution I can't access it because Xfinity wants me to activate their service and I'll have to resort to using my data to find that answer which isn't efficient for me at all.

Has anyone else experienced this problem and if so how can I fix it without dealing with customer service?",0

"Degraded upload speeds, support say signal is fine. I'm getting no help from them!Posted in the Comcast_Xfinity subreddit, but wanted to  complain here as well. I'm not getting much support from comcast, despite having service issues. I understand the issue is strange and hard to track down, but they are not owning up to it and helping out. 

Original text: 
Comcast customer in Chicago suburbs, I have a personally owned modem, personally owned router. My modem has several LAN ports, and I use some of them for hardwiring devices.

I've been experiencing intermittent degraded upload speeds the last several weeks. The problem tends to start in the evening, but not at any specific time. It is most notable because there are two gaming systems in the house, and gaming becomes problematic. Voice quality over party chat is affected (the other people we are playing with say our voices are choppy and low quality). We notice more lag in game. Download speeds remain solid during this time however.

I can run a speed test from several devices, laptops over wifi, game system plugged directly into modem, computers plugged in either modem or router. All devices show decent download speed but very poor upload speeds, mostly less than 1 Mbps, sometimes as low as 200 Kbps.

During the day time, we experience no issues, and speed tests done throughout the day show a full 8-10 Mbps upload speed.

I've had technicians out twice. Once during the day time, (upload speed as expected at the time), and once during the evening (upload speed degraded). Both technicians on both visits checked every part of the line to our house from the pole all the way to the inside of our house. They said the lines and signals were good.

During the second technician visit, I was skeptical of the ""good signal"" claim, and the technician rebutted me, saying that it was probably my modem, and since it's not a comcast owned modem, he wouldn't troubleshoot that.

I had a strong feeling it wasn't my modem (or any other line, or infrastructure since the problem is so intermittent and starts in the evening). So I went out to the store and bought a new modem. I plugged it in and had support activate the modem. Sure enough, the problem persisted. Another thing the 2nd technician did was schedule what he called a 'line check"", I have no visibility into whether this was completed or what they found.

So to recap, I have troubleshooted all aspects of the problem. I experience the problem in the evening only, but when I do, I see it across all devices in all configurations. I can remove my router completely, direct connect a laptop to the modem, and I get bad upload speed. I get bad upload speed when my router is plugged in and we are using all of our devices.

I've tried expressing this to the various support people I've talked to, but I just get the canned ""Oh have you tried rebooting? How many devices are on the WiFi?"" responses. I had one support person over chat disregard all of my description of the problem, and just dump me to a modem activation support rep.

At this time, I really need escalated support. I need Comcast to provide me some sort of test that I can perform and record my results in, so I can point to hard data that my speeds are affected. I need someone more than just the techs that know how to connect the coax line from the alley to my house. I've done all the troubleshooting already.

This problem is so weird, but so specific, that I'm convinced it has to be some configuration on Comcast's end.

Is there any way I can get in touch with someone that can help me directly?",0

"Self install SB8200, 1 blue light, cabling or config problem?I did a self install in my new house and moved my personal modem over to my new house. I appear to be locked to 100 down 38 up (I should have gigabit service). I figured maybe bad in home wiring and connected the modem directly to where the drop comes in and still get the same speed. Lights on the modem from the top to bottom are green blue green green (I think the middle 2 should be blue for docsis 3.1 gigabit). Even if its defaulting to docsis 3.0 shouldn't I be getting better speeds? Is this a cable issue ( new drop needs to be run) or a problem with the modem not getting the right config file? I called and they scheduled a professional install for today that I'm frankly dreading because I don't think I've ever had a tech fix a problem in my entire life with comcast.

"Xfinity Pods - devices not connecting to best optionI bought a 3 pack of the Xfinity pods a few weeks ago and am having mixed results with them. My main purpose for purchasing them was to extend the wifi reception to a studio I have out in my back yard. The pods were able to do this and I had set them up by daisy chaining them a little. However, I have been experiencing a fairly substantial downside with them.

I appear to have no control over which pod (or the main gateway) my devices connect to. According to the product description, they are supposed to automatically connect to the ""best"" option. However this does not appear to be the case. Even as i type this, I am about 10 feet from the main Xfinity gateway, where I would normally get around 60-100 Mbps. However, my laptop has decided to connect to the pod at the back of my house, and I'm only getting around 5Mbps.

This seems to be a common problem no matter what device I use and in each room. The device neither seems to select the closest, or fastest option.

Has anyone else experienced this and if so is there anything I can do to manually select which pod (or main gateway) I connect to?  Alternatively, if I cannot get this fixed I will probably return the pods so if anyone has alternative suggestions on how to boost the network so I have wifi in my studio at the back of the house I'd be interested to hear.

"I’m essentially forced to stay with Comcast for the next year. How can I avoid my bill doubling?Hello, 

I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, and for Internet, our two options are either Comcast or Frontier. 

My understanding (and somewhat experience) is that Frontier’s internet service is just as terrible as their customer service, but at least with Comcast, I get internet consistently. 

My contract will end in December. I need to get a new plan by January 17th, which is when the first bill at the higher rate will be written. I currently pay $29.99 for just internet. We don’t need cable or anything else. 

Every time I talk with Comcast to discuss my options, the “best price I can get” increases. Originally my quote for the next cheapest option was $34.99 which would be $44.09 including taxes and my autopay deduction. Then, it was a minimum of $55 after taxes and deductions. This is about what my bill would be if I do nothing. I can not afford this. I need the most  basic internet package available. 

We have seriously considered threatening to just cancel our service and then, if they call our bluff, having my bf get a plan under his name, but my understanding is that we could be without internet for several weeks if we do this. 

Does anyone have any tips or advice on how to move forward? Or if anyone has experience with Frontier, is that worth it?

I took advantage of the iPad offer back in August. Today is Novermber 11th, and I still have not received my product, though I have been billed for it.

Twice, Xfinity has shipped it to me. Twice I have not been notified until after Fedex has attempted to deliver, and the device returned to Xfinity. I’m not asking for much, just a tracking number at the time you ship it. With that in hand I can be home to receive and sign for it. Please consider : This last time you shipped the device on October 31st. The Xfinity reward website did not update until Novermber 7th, showing me that it had been shipped and giving me a FedEx tracking number. I immediately tracked the package, and lo and behold Fedex had attempted the delivery on November 2nd. That’s right, they tried to deliver it 5 days BEFORE Xfinity provided me with a tracking number. How could I have know it was coming? There’s no one else here to sign for it. And though I asked on several occasions to get the tracking info asap, and though I have been told the issue has been escalated and the person who’s got the ticket would be in touch, no one from Xfinity has called or emailed me. 

I am extremely disheartened , Comcast. I pay nearly $5000 dollars a year to you, between my Triple Pay package and my Xfinity mobile service.

We bought our house a little over 3 years ago and up until the other day we used Comcast for internet and voice and DirecTV for our TV service.

Keeping them separate got too expensive so I bundled everything to Comcast the other day. My self install kit and equipment should be arriving tomorrow.

For internet I own my own gateway/modem in bridge mode and Asus rt-ac68p router since I've already had Xfinity internet and voice, the main Comcast run is already in the house. It is an rg6 line. The previous owners must have had Comcast for all their services at one point because the main line is connected to a 4-way splitter with each output at 7db, but the only thing currently connected is the modem.

There are enough runs to the basement closet between all the DirecTV and previous Comcast runs that I dont have much wiring to do.

"Just need to ventSo I spent \~45 minutes in a chat with a Comcast employee that should have taken 5.

**Backstory**

I recently upgraded my TV channel package to make the wife happy. We use the Xfinity Stream Roku app to watch said channels. We had two old boxes that I never got around to returning so after making the change to the account we returned the boxes because it would save us another \~$8 per month in rental fees. The employee that helped me with the change assured me this wouldn't be an issue. After returning the boxes the new channels disappeared from the Stream app. So I got back in touch with Comcast.

**Present Day**

My first question in the chat was ""Do I need to have a cable box active on my account to gain access to all the channels I pay for?"" Made it very clear that we don't use the boxes but instead use the Rokus to access our channels. After repeated ""testing"" and ""health checks"" she very politely told me that it appears you need to have a cable box active on the account in order for all channels to appear.  So now I have to pay an additional $2.68 per month to access the channels that I already pay for. Here's the best part: As soon as the order went through the channels came back. I don't even have the box yet and never plan on taking it out of its packaging.

Called on the first, was told no, that promo isn't available. The only promo available was $20 more for faster service. I said no and cancelled the account to put it in my name.

I called once to see what the cheapest promo was. They didn't have the promo they mentioned, the one that was what my partner had for the past year. They only had the same service for $10 more. I hung up to check if any other providers in town had better prices. They do, but don't serve out apartment. Called back.

I was told the promo was the same as my partner's not promo price, almost twice the old promo. I said no, there is cheaper. He said ""oh, wait, yeah,"" and found the one that was $10 than what we had for a year. Because he didn't find my old account, he gave me two options: 1. autopay 2. credit check and monthly bills. I said I want a monthly bill because they like to sneak things onto bills. That meant a credit check.

All of this work, a few hours on the phone, to get by for another year with the most basic internet service at a price that isn't double what we have been spending. It's tiring.",0

"Comcast Business Fiber sucks!So our business has business fiber with Comcast, so that means we have a SLA with them two hour response for outage no matter what time of day. So first outage we had Comcast said their was a cut fiber and will take one hour to fix the fiber, no biggie at least I’m getting credit for it. So the next day we still have no internet, I call them up saying “what’s going on you said one hour repair time and nothing has been fixed” the representative said to us “I am sorry but you bin told you have standard internet with fiber and your problem should be fixed within two days”. Mind to you WE do have a service level agreement and a contract stating “All repairs will be done within four hour period”. The representative said “Comcast Business Dedicated Fiber has no SLA in their service”. To this fix point I said let us cancel your service since you haven’t met are contract and the service level agreement, stating “we are allowed to cancel to services with no early termination fee’s”. Of course the representative just gets angry and threatens me to add more fee’s.
For that I just hung up and went to call again, This time we called one of the managers let’s name his “Tom”. Tom knew other representative was totally out his way and shouldn’t be treating  customers this way. When Tom was looking are the service level agreement and contracts that my legal team signed for. He helped us to cancel the service, but I am still not happy about about the customer service, mind to you we have a 10gig symmetrical line, but also we had many outages and never got credited for the outages.
But for Tom who helped us wonderful to help cancel the services, when we are service level was agreement wasn’t met.
Still Comcast dedicates fiber sucks and to expensive for a third tier internet service provider.

Now we are with AT&T dedicated 10gig line, with a stronger service level agreement and contract. That states “any or made outages outside of dermac point, will have 30-1 hour repair window, above 1 hour you shall be credited for one month of downtime.”
Psst AT&T 10gig dedicated fiber is much much cheaper then we paid with Comcast.

Sorry Comcast, stick with residential internet service and not with business side.

"yet another ""internet is slow as hell"" postBasically I've had the problem for at least two or three weeks. Wi-fi connects just fine, but it loads completely slow (like takes a minute to load speedtests slow). Supposed to be getting 150mbps (so about 20 MB/s) and I'm averaging about 20 KB/s right now. I've already had them reset it over the phone, didn't work. A tech came out here, replaced/rewired the coax, even replaced the router, still doesn't work. It's not my Wi-fi adapter, it's a TP-Link AC1200 adapter (specifically the T4UH model) and I tethered a Moto G Play to it, which doesn't even support AC wifi, and that gives me a fair bit faster connection (around 10 mb/1.2MB per sec, can go faster but signal in my apartment kinda sucks.

Going by [this guide,](https://www.reddit.com/r/Atlanta/comments/4jqyrg/til_how_to_troubleshoot_slow_internet_service_a/) I can't run netalyzr because my browser doesn't support Java (firefox), running it via phone took just over 30 minutes via wifi and I couldn't type the results address fast enough before the link just disappeared.

"Comcast doing away with 25/mbps plan?Prefacing this by saying that I live in the Northern, VA area and have been a Comcast Xfinity customer for around 3 years now. I joined Xfinity on the 25/mbps plan at the starting special of $29.99 (Definitely a good deal). The following year it went up to $54.95. I called in and they found a no contract special to bring it back down to $49.99. The $49.99 price has been set for the past couple of years.

This year, I got a notice that I was being upgraded to the 60/mbps tier for free. I called in and asked the rep if there would be any increase in price. He ensured me that there wouldn't be and that Comcast was most likely removing the 25/mbps tier and upgrading everyone to 60/mbps. Fast forward half a year and I have now seen my $49.99 bill go up to $66 and now $69.95.

I called back in today and asked if there are any promos or discounts for internet only plans and there are none currently being run. The really interesting thing is that the rep said that their performance starter internet (25/mbps) is available at the every day price of $49.95. Looking at the Xfinity website, the performance starter tier is listed at ***15/mbps not 25/mpbs***. I mentioned that to her and she didn't seem familiar with the online tier/pricing.

I'm guessing Comcast is ""upgrading"" people in certain areas to a higher tier, telling them the lower/cheaper tier is being dropped, and then gradually increasing their monthly bill to that new tier's every day pricing. For the most part, I've been happy with Comcast's service but this seems rather dishonest to push people to a higher tier and then tell them the lower/cheaper tier is being done away with when it actually isn't.

Does anyone know if there's a completely different price/tier structure online versus what you get when you call in and ask them about plans?",0
"There’s got to be something I can doHey guys, I’ve had issues with my internet just dying every half an hour, and it’s something on Comcast’s end.

"Can I renew service in a different name to get a new customer rate?A year ago, my partner switched my account to her name because she wanted to handle the bill. She got the $29.99 rate.

"I'm a tech and here's why your tech did a bad jobComcast has a business model for entry level employees (techs, call centers, etc.)  to make them feel inadequate.  If they feel like they didn't do enough, they'll do more, right?  No.  They'll just try to make the system happy which leaves the customer screwed.  Here's how it works:  There's a point system for types of jobs.  Your stuff not working and it's been installed is worth 16 points.  You try to install stuff yourself (Self Install Kit/SIK) and it doesn't work is worth 29 points.  Installations vary by the number of items to be installed, what services you're receiving....basically, the more you pay a month, the more points the install is worth.  I've seen as high as 96 points for an install.  You can already see a problem with SIK.  You were somehow expected to install 5 items?  No, but the salesman told you that if you try and it doesn't work, a tech will come do it for free.  They sure will.  They're also going to try to adhere to the points, 29, or they're going to catch hell for being unproductive.  So they hook up all 5 of your digital items with the analog cable system in your house as fast as they can and you now have issues.  Now you have to have another tech come out. That's a troublecall.  16 points.  Even less points than the last guy and he has to do everything the last guy didn't do.  For less.  So he does the fastest get-by job possible and you're still screwed.  So what if you read this before your install and you think, ""I'll just pay for the installation and have it done right.""?  That SHOULD work.  Not always.  If your tech is behind on this ridiculous point system for the month, he's still cutting every corner he can.  There is a ton more to it all than what I'm putting here.  There is a test the tech has to complete successfully before he can complete the job and move on.  This test is treated as infallible but it is incredibly inaccurate and has no business being anything more than 'at a glance'.  Techs have to waste a ton of time trying to get this thing to give them an accurate answer.  It's based off of signal recordings on your modem and X1 devices.  Those devices were never meant to be a meter and so do a terrible job of recording this stuff accurately.  It's why a tech may have swapped out your modem for some bs reason.  Think of it as turning the spare bedroom into a nursery because a pregnancy test from WalGreens came up positive.  Nobody does that because everyone knows those tests aren't the most accurate.  Comcast doesn't care if the test is accurate.  They'll still hold techs up at least once a day at a house over it and that time wasted has to be made up somewhere and that's why your tech did a terrible job.

If you get a contractor, you think you're ok?  Nope.  They're paid by the job based on the credit that job is given.  Very similar to the point system above.  So if that tech is working for the credit instead of what the job deserves, you're going to be left with a badly done job.  I left Comcast due to them preaching accountability and then putting all accountability on entry level and went to work as a contractor.  My last house I was at had accidentally unplugged the amp.  Before the amp had been unplugged, everything was working great.  I plugged the amp back in, everything came back up, and the test I mentioned before failed with completely impossible and inaccurate readings.  I spent 4 hours at that house.  Made $16 for 4 hours because of a ridiculous job scoring system.  Hopefully, my landlord will understand because this kind of crap happens a lot and I can't afford rent.  Wasn't the Civil War fought over people not paying people for the work they did?  I guess the founder of Comcast and his son, who has taken over,  were from the deep south so I can see where this mentality comes from.",0

"PSA - Data Usage Messages and HTTPEarlier this morning, I found that I was unable to connect to websites using HTTP; sites would only load when using HTTPS. Being the network junkie I am, I began working back from my equipment trying to isolate the issue. After some quick experimentation, I found that I was able to use any service other than HTTP with the raw Comcast connection, and that HTTP did indeed work when I routed it through a VPN. It was at this point that I remembered that Comcast performs Man in the Middle attacks on their customers' HTTP connections occasionally to inform them that they've blown through their data cap, or that they have an active copyright notice (see [https://www.neowin.net/news/comcast-begin-man-in-the-middle-attacks-to-show-copyright-notices-on-websites/](https://www.neowin.net/news/comcast-begin-man-in-the-middle-attacks-to-show-copyright-notices-on-websites/) for some further reading on the subject). Furthermore, I received a text message about blowing through the cap last night.

&#x200B;

As it turned out, the system that Comcast uses to initiate the MITM attack was failing to work properly. This led to me being unable to load HTTP content.

&#x200B;

The solution? I called Comcast and had them check for any unacknowledged notices regarding my data cap. There was indeed such a notice. Once they acknowledged it from their end for me, everything began working as it should. I asked them to escalate the ticket to their engineering team so they can investigate why the problem occurred and work to prevent it from occurring in the future.

Until the issue is resolved on Comcast's end, hopefully this can shine some light on what might be a very confusing issue for many users.",0

A group of friends and I run a dedicated server hosted by Leaseweb in The Netherlands data center. We operate an open source private streaming platform on it. When watching video on the platform, during the day time hours connection it is fine on Comcast. In the evenings, around 7:30/8 pm, the buffering/download speed from the server drops dramatically. The problem does not seem to occur on other ISP's I've tried. We cant find any cause on the servers end (no one else is experiencing the issue) and I've tried multiple devices and connected directly to the modem to rule out hardware here at home. I need someone to verify on Comcast's end that there is no throttling or interference with the traffic on Comcast's end. The fact that it drops nightly at a specific time until early morning is suspect to me, and since its occurring while directly connected to the modem I was wondering if there was some sort of peak hours throttling causing the problem.

Any help or information would be greatly appreciated, have been fighting this issue for months now with dead ends.",0

"Triple Play Modem Options?Ok so I just found out that my intermittent, persistent latency issues is probably related to my Puma 6 chipset in the rented TG1682G modem, and am looking to replace it with another.

&#x200B;

We have the 250 mbps plan, and the modem is in bridge mode connected to a Netgear Orbi system. We get good speeds, but it often takes a while to connect and when I'm playing games, I get a lot of lag spikes. Wiring my xbox directly to the orbi satellite helped (and I get 250-300 mbps on [fast.com](https://fast.com) in the xbox web browser) but did not totally cure the issue.

&#x200B;

Therefore, I don't need a combo modem/router inherently. I was looking at the xfinity my device options, and I have 3 options: Arris SVG2482AC, Netgear C7100V, and a standalone Netgear CM500V.

  
The Arris SVG2482AC has the same Puma 6 chipset, so that is out.

&#x200B;

So I am looking between the C7100V for $300, which obviously will work but might be overkill.

And the CM500V which is only $100 but is rated for lower speeds overall. And this comparison site ([https://stickystatic.com/tech/approved-voice-modem](https://stickystatic.com/tech/approved-voice-modem)) says it is not adequate for speeds over 200 mbps.

I have read some other things that said the CM500v will be OK for speeds up to 300 mbps.

And there are literally 10 stupid unneeded fees on the TV service. Regional sports fee, broadcast fee, what the f-ck does all this sh-t even mean? I'm going to give you a comparison to a company that ACTUALLY CARES about its customer experience. I have paid the exact same rate at T-Mobile even including taxes and fees which they include in the price for THREE YEARS. Never once have they raised any fee or added any amount of money on a bill out of the blue. I want to get rid of Comcast as fast as I possibly can, but I feel like Im trapped into something I feel like you're not supposed to be without like TV.

"Weirdo Comcast Routing Issues?So, I have a customer on Comcast Business. Their employees routinely VPN into the company network, however yesterday a subset of those users reported they were unable to connect to VPN. After a bit of investigating, it became evident that the only employees affected are ones who were connecting from an xfinity home connection. All others on ATT/Verizon/Sonic/etc can still VPN just fine.

&#x200B;

Running tracert from the employees xfinity connection at home to the company firewall gets into the general area of the business (walnut creek, ca), but promptly drops off. The company firewall shows no traffic from the xfinity IP's we're testing from.

&#x200B;

I opened a ticket yesterday but apparently it is ""yet to be assigned"".

&#x200B;

Anyone seen anything like this before?

&#x200B;

UPDATE: So, tracert suddenly started completing. What is even weirder now, however, is that I will ping the firewall or gateway, the pings will fail, i'll tracert to the firewall or gateway, the tracert will complete (after a long pause on the last hop to the gateway), then I'll ping the firewall or gateway, and the pings complete. I'll wait a few minutes, ping the firewall or gateway again and no dice.

The very long hop happens from lag1-acr09.walnutcreek.ca.sfba.comcast.net \[68.85.216.38\] to our gateway. If I tracert directly to the gateway, the trace completes quickly.",0
"XRE 03091 error code when fast forwarding through commercialsLike the title says, when I'm watching a dvr recorded show, I can't fast forward through commercials without this error. The first time I thought it was a corruption with the recording. However, when I don't fast forward, it works just fine. As soon as I start fast forwarding, maybe after the second commercial that I skipped, I get this error and it tells me that there's an on demand version available that, of course, doesn't allow fast forwarding. This is blatantly a way to get me to watch commercials right? It's just too fishy.

"Comcast has a block on my addressAt first it was because of the previous tenant, I sent copies of my lease, DL, and SSC. 

I had done these steps about 3 years ago when I first moved in, and my services where never actually transferred to my new address. Comcast set me up with an account for my address and I continued to pay for about 4 more months until I realized I wasn't getting the tv part of the bundle I was paying for every month. I paid everything I owed and closed my account. That was in early 2016.

Fast forward back to this week. After I submitted my info for proof of resistance, comcast lifted the block on the address and replaced it with another block for a $50 collections on an address that I never lived in. (Technically same address different apartment number). After talking to a couple of representatives, no one could tell me what the $50 is for or why I was even charged in the first place. I was trying to get services set up for that apt when the ceiling collapsed and we had to move to a different unit (this was 2014). I cancelled everything and should have never been charged anything under Comcast's ""30 day money back gaurantee.""

So now my credit is probably being affected bc comcast sent me to collections for a $50 charge from 2014, and they can't tell me what the charge is for. I also can't set up new service until that $50 is paid.

I've had this conversation so many times over the years. I feel like I'm losing my mind.

"I have 1-2% packet loss, but it seems to stop when I connect to a VPN. Pingplotter data inside. Help!Short background: I recently had a comcast tech out to my house for this issue. He said he didnt see any packet loss where the line comes into the house which is where my modem is. He said it's probably my modem. I bought a new modem. It's still happening.

Things tried:

- Comcast tech removed old splitter and wired my modem directly to the line. This improved cable signal levels, though they were never completely out of range, they were borderline.
- Changed all coax and ethernet cables, including wall plate.
- Hooked PC directly to modem
- Went from 16x4 modem to 24x8 channel modem.

[Here](https://puu.sh/BNr2c/b1c2125d7d.png) are my current cable signal levels /w new modem MB7621 and no splitter.

[Here's](https://puu.sh/BNsb9/0337af2afe.png) with my old modem SB6183 (splitter was also hooked up)

I thought maybe the issue was somewhere down the line, but according to pingplotter, I think the problem is the first hop. (Note: I barely know anything about interpreting pingplotter data). However, when I connect to a VPN, I dont see any lost packets in pingplotter. 

&nbsp;

Here is my pingplotter data: *Note, ive tried other servers such as 8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1, yahoo.com, comcast.net, and it still happens.

No VPN: [Screenshot](https://imgur.com/Ncv8nEU) | [Pingplotter .pp2 file](https://puu.sh/BNs0A/cdfbb5d3f1.pp2)

Could I still be losing the packets while connected to VPN and the pingplotter wouldn't show it? I don't understand networking very well in this scenario.

"DTA overlay cut offMy grandmother's Pace RNG110 DTA is outputting a 4:3 overlay to her 16:9 TV, but rather than scaling it down to fit height-wise it just chops off the top and bottom to fit it width-wise. The channels themselves display fine, as a 16:9 image fitting the TV perfectly and with nothing cut off. She can watch any show without issue except in as much as the guide and other overlay elements are partially cropped out, which is a big problem when I try to turn on closed captioning for her.

I've checked the TV's display settings to make sure it doesn't have some peculiar zoom enabled (like a pillar boxed 16:9 signal which is being zoomed back into a 16:9 image), and I've checked the DTA's settings to ensure it's in 16:9 mode rather than 4:3 (by powering on the DTA using the menu button to access settings not available in the normal settings menu). They're connected with an HDMI cable. I've tried turning on the TV's own closed captioning in the hope that the DTA might pass the data through to it, but no such luck. The overlay is the old light blue one cable boxes used to have which was designed to show up on terrible CRTs so I'm not surprised there isn't a 16:9 format of it, but I'm really hoping there's some way to get it to scale properly over a 16:9 image. Anyone encountered anything like this before, where the overlay is cropped but the picture itself isn't?

"Comcast claims I downloaded over 100GBs overnight while I wasn't even home.In less than 5 days Comcast claims I've already used 200GBs of data.

I can account for roughly 90GBs.

Yesterday I wasn't even home for more than 2 hours, didn't even get a chance to use my PC. None of my other devices are connected to an internet source. But when I checked how much data usage I'm at now, it's 100GBs over what it was previously the day before.

How? So now I'm sitting at roughly 350GBs of data useage in less than 10 days. Last month, I didn't even hit 300gbs. But then some months, like during the summer, it claims I pushed 700gb? 

The comcast rep I spoke to wanted me to schedule an appointment to have a tech rip my router of my wall. I unfortunately just don't have the time to do this, nor the patience. 

Roughly over a year ago there was an incident where comcast claimed I downloaded THREE TERABYTES worth of data in a month. This is back when I only had 500gbs of storage readily available. I was able to get them to redact that bill thankfully.

I feel like I'm starting to face the same situation, except this time Comcast isn't nearly as friendly anymore.

There is an unrealistic amount of data being claimed I use. ",0
"Paying for Blast pro and getting single digit downsSo for context we used to have a 150 mbps plan and as our plan was running out we decided to move up to 250 mbps along with tv and it was great for a few days, our speeds went from roughly 160 mbps up to 200 (testing done with a wired connection). Only recently (roughly 2 days now and counting) our internet speeds plummeted down to a 3-4 mbps down with upload speeds staying at a static 10ish mbps. Its actually breaking me down knowing that were paying for 250 mbps and getting these shit speeds. When i went to the live chat and talk to a rep the rep said that everything was good on their end and things were working fine. Ive narrowed the problem down to coverage in my area just taking a hit and its hopefully getting fixed soon cause this is stupid or i might need a new modem.

I am a very avid gamer and going from a stable 150 mbps to 3-4 has my gameplay in the gutter and it infuriates me, i cant play with my friends because I know im gonna be lagging and it makes me feel like im bringing nothing to the table other than extra weight.  

I am more than happy to supply anyone whos willing to help me take the next step in fixing my problem with the information needed, thanks in advance",0

"Comcast Unlimited Data Usage QuestionMy family has had the Comcast Unlimited Data Usage as we go well beyond our data cap of 1TB (we pay an additional $50 per month). Before we went on this plan, we had used up two of the ""courtesy months"" back in December of 2016 and January of 2017, and ever since February of 2017, we have been paying for the unlimited data usage. However, we were told that every 12 month period, we receive two courtesy months where we basically get a ""pass"" for avoid having to pay the $50.

This thus led me thinking on whether we can turn off our unlimited data usage for the next billing month, and the following one, and then re-enable the unlimited data usage plan. But before I even do all of this, is this exactly how the system works? I have talked with the agents, and then chatted with an agent and I am hearing conflicting information. One person said it's two courtesy months for the life of the account, the other said its two courtesy months for every 12 month period. Would someone who is in a similar plan mind clarifying if I would be able to use my ""two courtesy months"" or does it not exist once you use it during the life of the account? For reference, ever since we have added on the unlimited data usage plan, we have gone well beyond the cap every single month.",0

"Xfinity Mobile S9+ dramaBack when the s9 first launched and Xfinity Mobile was offering a promotion if you pre-ordered, I did it. The service was okay, but I really had an issue with not being able to pay in advance and the fact that their charges bypassed me having overdraft protection disabled on my debit card, leading to overdraft fees a few months. So last month I paid off the phone, got the unlock code, and went to switch providers, I tried to go to Sprint, and they were able to get the text and calling working, but no data. Then I went to TMobile, but after being with them for a month, I hate the service and it seems like Xfinity has sabotaged the phone in a way that made it so that the phone only works correctly on their Network. I tried to go back to Xfinity after my month was over with TMobile, but apparently they can't reuse my Xfinity SIM card and I have to drive 25 minutes to the Xfinity store or wait for a new card to be shipped to me in order for it to re activated.

"*ONE SPECIFIC* xfinitywifi hotspot is not doling out IP addresses...... it just so happens to be the one that I can reach from my AirBNB.

&#x200B;

*FULL STORY BELOW*

I am from New Jersey. For the last 2 months, I've been in Baltimore (3 hours away) on a work assignment.

&#x200B;

The wifi in my AirBNB is horrible, so I have been using an xfinitywifi hotspot which I can reach from my AirBNB.

&#x200B;

For 2 months, it has worked perfectly.

&#x200B;

This past week (Monday, I think), it stopped working.

&#x200B;

I was too busy with work things to troubleshoot it this week, but I tried to connect each day and it did not work all week.

&#x200B;

This morning I finally had time to troubleshoot.

&#x200B;

I have tried to connect with 5 different devices:

&#x200B;

2x laptops

2x phones

1x Amazon Fire TV stick

&#x200B;

All exhibit the same behavior: They cannot get an IP address from the hotspot.

&#x200B;

It's clearest to see what is happening with the phones. You hit the hotspot, it goes into ""Obtaining IP address"" and sits there.

&#x200B;

After 3-4 minutes, it returns an error: ""IP Configuration Failure""

&#x200B;

I've spent hours on the phone with both Comcast Live Chat and Phone Support and it has been extremely disappointing.

&#x200B;

Even though I kept telling the rep that I am nowhere near home, the she kept sending signals to my home modem to see if it would fix the problem.

&#x200B;

And when that didn't work, she told me that there are too many people trying to connect to the hotspot, this is why it's not working.

&#x200B;

She didn't seem to understand that it was working perfectly for 2 months and suddenly stopped working. Kept blaming it on my equipment or ""too many people trying to connect.""

&#x200B;

All the other xfinitywifi hotspots around town work just fine -- it's just this specific one on West Preston St in Baltimore.

&#x200B;

And again - it's only been the past week. Before that, it worked perfectly!

&#x200B;

Now I've been on Twitter with @ComcastCares and I'm getting the runaround: ""No, we can't remotely reboot it."" ... ""It must be an inaccessible hotspot."" ... ""I just checked the node activity at that location and nothing is showing up as a problem. ""

&#x200B;

So wait - your equipment shows there's no problem, so I must be nuts? Why would I waste hours of my life trying to get you to fix a problem that isn't a problem?

&#x200B;

Who is manning this Twitter account? Have they had any customer service training at all? Empathy with the customer is half the battle!

&#x200B;

Why does no one seem to care? Spoken to three different reps now - I've literally wasted my whole Saturday on this garbage.

&#x200B;

I wish I could move on, but I'll be *LIVING HERE FOR (at least) THE NEXT 30 DAYS* with a perfectly broken wifi hotspot!

"Question: Comcast Business router gateway firewall: Max Security + allow port 22I have a business need to set my gateway firewall to ""**Maximum Security (High)**, which will block most applications except web browsing, email, iTunes and VPN."" 

But I want to open up port 22 for all devices so that it's possible for developers to use SSH with github and connect to remote servers. (Without having to use a VPN service.)

"Roku express as a replacement box - will it work away from home?Long story short, Im living in two places right now.  Im working far away from my house, so I made an arrangement to stay there during the week, and then I go home for the weekends/days off.

I pay for comcast at home.  I have a few channels, and also HBO and a few others.  The place Im staying has no cable, so I've been using my chromecast to stream netflix.

Ive read about using a roku as a set top box replacement in home.  I was planning on eventually adding this to the TV in the spare bedroom, but it also got me thinking - what would happen if I took that roku (registered to my account), and brought it to my weekday place?  Would it still work normally?  Or is there some restriction where you need to be in the same house?

Finally, if there is some restriction, could it be solved by using a vpn/vps to fool the box so it thinks its on the same network?  

Not a huge deal either way, but when away I miss just putting on some garbage TV in the background.  With netflix its just not the same.  I wish there was a ""put some crappy show on where I dont have to pay attention"" channel.

"Comcast AD Injection Into http websiteToday, while browsing [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CayleyGraph.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CayleyGraph.html)  (for programming) I got a pop up ad stating that my modem is old, and I  could upgrade to a comcast modem to get better speeds. Wolfram is a  completely ad free website...

This means:

1. comcast did packet analysis on my traffic.
2. determined the content was a website
3. injected their own ad

"Random internet outages, possibly issues with connection between modem and ISP terminalI have been having random internet outages about once or twice a day the entire 2 years I have been living in my current home with my comcast internet. Initially I just blamed a poor network setup (using powerline adapters and crappy wifi) but then I installed a proper wired network and I continued to have the same issue. I then looked into my modem which it turned out had lots of amazon reviews indicating the same problem so I replaced that with a Netgear CM700. That did not improve the situation with daily outages lasting upwards of 10 minutes still occurring. The new modem does keep a much more detailed log though. Typically T3 timeouts but I have attached the most recent log file. The last thing I did was eliminate all splitters from the path, directly connecting the modem to the line that comes form the box outside. This initially seemed to help but it seems that was just a coincidence since it has since been acting up again. I would also like to be able to use splitters so that cable TV would be an option as well. I live in a townhouse, second farthest unit from the terminal at the end of the building. The cable passes through the other unit's attics before getting to mine so replacing the cable may be complicated...

What can I do about this? I'm assuming I am going to have to have a technician come look at it. Will they hassle me over having my own modem instead of renting theirs? The problem is really intermittent so is there anything specific I should be telling them or data I should be saving so they don't come here and find nothing? What would repairs of such an issue be likely to cost?

If nothing changes, we're definitely switching and I've begun leaving the link to check the speed from ATT for neighbors and friends in the area so they can switch as well.

Comcast will compensate us by giving us a few bucks back for the day but I don't need the money, I need the service I pay a hundred dollars for every month.

"Comcast said I violated their highspeed policy?Hello, I was having a conversation on discord and it led into my friend and I joking about stuff within context of the conversation about doing stupid stuff.

"This shouldn’t even be an issueThe only things connected to my modem that are actively using the internet are an Apple TV that’s streaming a movie, a single phone that’s browsing social media, and a PS4 that’s hooked up via an Ethernet (the Ethernet btw is connected wirelessly, and yes, I made sure that wasn’t the actual issue). 

I just spent more than an hour slogging through a mission with three friends only to get disconnected at the very end (final boss killed as well). 

I understand that my PS4 isn’t in the same room, but this happens way more than it needs to be. My modem does this even when I’m just on my phone in my room. It seems that if there’s even the slightest bit of activity from another device, the internet will go from consistently smooth to dead for a minute or more. 

Fuck Comcast, this shit shouldn’t even be happening

Hook one part to the modem and the other to a device. They connect to each other in a closed system (literally set it up by just plugging both into separate outlets and plugging in the Ethernet cables, nothing else). Realistically (I assume at least) the modem is only talking to one device, but that device is talking to another that’s talking to the console.

Also, this has happened a bunch before I got this thing (only had it for a month, even less than, and this is the first it’s happened). Tried connecting to WiFi and the connection does the same thing, only slower internet. WiFi in my room is about 10Mbps, the Ethernet bumps into the 30Mbps range, maybe even more than that. Keep in mind, this thing is connecting through two or three walls, which is honestly great with the physical limitations. ",0

Stream tv is infinitely better than comcast linear channels on the boxI figured out what bitrate is needed for each resolution NBA tv was at 3.5 mbps. Which is equal to 1080p resolution. I know the box is higher bitrate it's at 6k but here's the thing comcast down rezes the resolution to 720p60 so bit rate doesn't matter only is comcast box connection is more stable and streaming there will be drops but it's worth it overall for a better quality picture it definitely looks clearer. One of the sd channels was at 1.5 mbps which is 720p quality. Only thing stream tv has it in a black border but pq is definetly better than box. That's my studying for the day. Also ESPN 3 on x1 is also good cause it's internet and probably at 1080p.,0

"Had to tell someone I was finally able to leave Comcast, and tag... you're it!I do not like reddit, for a large number of reasons. But the largest is that what people do with such a small amount of power is sure odd to me.

I live in South Florida. I actually worked for Comcast in 2010, for about a year. What I say about that experience is, ""Remember when Han Solo cut open the bantam on Hoth? He said ... 'I thought these things smelled bad ... on the OUTSIDE.'""

&#x200B;

Because when you work for Comcast, you can completely understand why everyone hates it. I remember an office poster with this guy and it said, ""We're listening!"" The guy had a constipated look on his face ... he's listening so hard. In actual, fact, what they do is hear you, but never, ever listen to you. One of the things they do is give employees free cable, internet, etc., so that you can actually work there without hating Comcast too much.

&#x200B;

I do not know if I was fired or quit. Eight years later, and about two weeks ago, the internet starts getting real spotty, and it's time to for my annual call. That is their thing. ""We'll make it better"" ... but it will never work without me having to call. That's the part I hate the most, is that they think it is normal to have to call them about once a year or so to fix their sh\*t.

&#x200B;

Add this to the normal stuff that comes with Comcast. I do not know about ATT, to which I switched. But Comcast is about 50% commercials. I am old enough to remember when I was monetized only once. We got TV for free, and the commercials WERE the monetization. Comcast's brilliant strategy was to charge on top of that, monetizing twice. They're actually going to sell browsing history, which will monetize everyone three times.

&#x200B;

Add to this, the programming itself is just garbage. What the hell is ""Cake Boss""? Do I even want to click on that to answer my own question? (no). What's this, ""Baking in Britain?"" These last few months, looking at the programming, taking about ten or fifteen minutes to find anything, I realized that I really just wanted out.

&#x200B;

Today I made the call. Long story short, I'll be an ATT Uverse customer by Sunday. I'm not happy, but I am relieved. I hope for stable internet. It is really all I wanted.

"Reoccurring issues with XfinityFor over a month now my family has been experiencing substantial issues with our internet connection. We've had Xfinity for a very long time, back when they were still under the name of Comcast. Even back then, we had minor issues. This, however, takes the cake.

Consistently our internet is completely shut off. Wifi and direct line both are shut at a random point in the afternoon, almost always right after 3 PM, but today it was about 1:45 PM. I'm on 4G right now, so I can write this. The internet is still experiencing issues.

We called Xfinity about it yesterday, and their explanation is that the router/hardware they gave us is no longer used, and that they would get us a new one Friday. This is odd, because we got this new one this year, not even 6 months ago.

Now, I'm not making any major claims. I had some people say it's throttling now that NN is gone. I had others say it's like what Xfinity says, a hardware issue. But why is it doing it now and not when we got the new router?

I'm at a loss as to what the real issue is. We're on the verge of switching, which would be a lot of work. Anyone with a bit more experience have some insight?",0
"Internet randomly cuts off at night.This is something that has happened to me at two separate residences. Every 2-3 months between midnight and 3 a.m. the internet will cut off for a couple of hours. This is really damn irritating. At both houses I have had different equipment. The residences are in the same county though. I know Comcast is purposely cutting off internet in this county at night for something. I don't know what they do it for, and of course no notice is ever given. Just like clockwork though, every 2-3 months at the same time period the internet goes offline.

"Bait and switch?I was wandering around Best Buy in Union City when a Comcast guy approaches me and says he can save me about $40 a month on my bill if I agree to the installation of a digital box/recorder, a home security system, and lock me into a 2 year contract if I pay them $99.  I kept asking what the catch was.  So I do it, an installer does the install and then a week or so later I notice my old movie channels aren't there.  I come to find out he changed my service to a cheap Latino package, with reduce services, and I don't remotely look Mexican.

So I get my original service back and then today I come to find my bill is actually higher and I had to pay $99 for that privilege.  I managed to get them to refund the $99.

However, what ever happened to the several month intro rate discount they'd give you when they screw up?  I've been paying $220 a month for years.  Ridiculous for TV with commercials on nearly every channel.  I don't get showtime, hbo, cinimax, etc.

Getting my $99 back for having to pay a higher rate is one thing.  After that I was put through to the customer loyalty department expecting to get some intro rate for a few months which occurred to me many years ago when I had my cable disconnected due to their mistake.  I was conned with a pure bait and switch(latino package) and all the loyalty guy would do was to cut my rate by a trivial $18 by taking away a few services.  No discount.

"Comcast RegretTLDR at bottom.

I moved into a new apartment in March that offered comcast internet and TV services. At the time I was able to get the basic package with HBO and an Internet boost included. Was still pricey, and I was bummed because some channels I was used to on my previous basic plan were not included (local sports channel for baseball, had it at my previous apartment on comcast basic), but overall was fine with it.

On Septmeber 4th I was called about upgrading. They said I would be able to keep my internet boost, and get more channels for $20 more a month. I was told I'd get a 30 day window to switch back to my old plan. Made sure to ask if I would keep my boost and get HBO back (not included in upgrade, but didn't use it that much) if I went back. It was all ""Yes yes yes"" and then reiterating how all the men needed their sports and how great a deal this was. Was also told there would be no other charges, after I asked.

I checked my bill a few days ago and saw an $18 charge for the internet boost and a $25 service charge. Didn't think it was that big of a deal, but it was not what I was told. I planned on canceling anyways, I dont watch the sports channels enough.

I called today to cancel and was informed that I could not go back to my previous plan, as it stop being offered in July. People still have it who are grandfathered in, but they dont offer it. I waited for the agent to discuss the situation with her manager and received the received special approval. My bill will be the same a previously, with the same basic channels, but I lose my speed boost and HBO. They had to pull strings, and I still lose out on $30+ of services. I was obviously frustrated, but I know it wasn't the agents fault- they did a good job. The agent filed a complaint for me, but I was wondering if their was anything else I could do? 

TLDR: upgraded for a month, was misinformed (bordering on lied to), pay same bill as before upgrade with less services",0

Last night I was not so kindly informed that I could not connect to the internet because they red-flagged my address for too many accounts over the years, some of which didn’t pay their bills (do you not know how rental properties work you dipshits?!). I was told that my internet was disconnected, my address was flagged, and my account cancelled/closed, and in order to get it restored, I need to go to one of their brick and mortar stores with my social security card, state ID, and proof of residency.

"Hello, having major home internet issue  

Hello, I seem to have a weird internet connection problem with my home network. In my home the internet connection seems to be weak for all computers in most parts of the house except the basement room where the router is. The router is connected to a computer through Ethernet cable, and this computer seems to have the best and most stable connection of all. Above basement level the laptops and also the mac have connections that are feint or slow and aren't using an Ethernet cable. Even our cell phones that are connected to the home network have a feint or slow connection. 

Connection for entire house only seems stable when right after calling Comcast and having them send a surge or whatever to my house, but its only temporary.

I know its not a hardware issue on the laptops part because when I took my laptop to a hotel in ocean city it worked fine with the hotel WiFi, but at my home it doesn’t have as strong as connection as my computer that is directly connected to the router in the basement.

I was wondering how to solve this and what could be the problem. I want all the computers/laptops/phones connected to our home comcast  network to have good stable connection but it seems only the computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable has good stable connection.

Could it be because the router is really old? It’s like 10 yrs. old.",0
"Intermittent internet connection issuesHello all,

I've been having this problem for about a month and a half, have had three service technicians and four different modems. I have spent over 10 hours on the phone with netgear and comcast and the issue has still not been solved. I am frustrated and all out of options as it seems no one wants to help, hopefully I can get some advice here.

I am experiencing small intermittent drops in my internet which are extremely noticeable when gaming or watching a stream. When a technician comes to the house they say nothing is wrong because I am getting the speeds. It is impossible for them to detect these drops with their tiny Ipads. I have ran ping test recently and see that the request timed out multiple times through the test. These drops happen about every 15 minutes or so. The drops will throw me out of a game and cut my connection completely for a very short interval of time.

To recap, I only receive these drops when gaming, streaming, or using discord.  Which is everything I do. These drops happen throughout the entire day, non-time specific. Could this be a firewall issue? Comcast seems to not wanna come and inspect the lines, even though I have asked multiple times.

Any advice is super appreciate :)

If the problem continues I will be sure to post back here. As as someone recommended, I will call Comcast until the tech has a black eye lol.

I want to thank everyone so much for all the feed back. Sad how the company hasn't even responded on their fourm yet but y'all we so quick and helpful. Much Love

&#x200B;

I recently decided to get cable, primarily for sports viewing.  I already had xfinity for internet, but had a digital antenna for my network TV.  Even on my 4K TV, over the air picture quality was decent.  (My understanding is most air broadcasting is in 720p, which my TV likely upscaled internally.)  For the record, TV is a 55"" Samsung curved 4k something something.

&#x200B;

I hooked up my new box last night (all connections secure, only one splitter, short runs with both coax and hdmis), and the picture quality is abysmal.  Movement is jerky, picture is highly pixelated across all HD channels.  I switched the output on my box (xg2v2) to 1080p, and it did basically nothing.  I messed with my TV settings and it's still awful.  

&#x200B;

I've done research and have seen two major schools of thought.  (1) Some people say comcast is overcompressing or something like that, and that there is no hope for improvement.  (2) Others say that some of the  boxes from the previous generation did a better job of transmitting pictures that were at least acceptable for viewing on a 4k TV.  Do any of you kind people have any ideas?  Right now I'm just fuming that I agreed to tack $50/mo onto my bill for the next couple of years just to get a worse experience.",0

"I dislike Comcast as much as anyone else, but yesterday, I had a positive experience with Tech SupportMy internet connection went down at 2pm.  TV and phone were fine.  I power-cycled my personally owned router/WiFi, but that did not fix it.  I waited for 10 mintutes to see if it would fix itself.  It didn't.  I hit the reset switch on the Comcast supplied modem.  That did not fix it.

I called 800-COMCAST.  I tried the automated system to send a reset to the modem.  The voice said it could take as much as 10 minutes to work.  It asked it it could send me an SMS TXT to confirm that it had worked. I set up a repeating ping 4.2.2.4 so that I could see when it reconnected.

About 5 minutes later, it reconnected.  Hurray!  about 5 minutes later, Comcast TXT asking if it was working.  I replied SUCCESS.  1 minute later, it went down again, so I TXT FAILURE.  They TXT asking if they could call me to further resolve the problem.  I replied YES, and within 1 minute, they called and connected me with a Technician.

I explained to the Tech what had happened so far.  He did quick diagnostics, then send a RESET signal to my modem.  Within 5 minutes of that, it came back online, and has been fine ever since.

I was impressed with the overall speed, the TXT process, and how they connected me to a Tech who solved my problem.  Kudos to the company that usually gets shat upon.",0

"""Cloud Storage"" is Less than Your X1 DVR - You Lose RecordingsThis may have been mentioned already, but... 

Using the desktop and tablet apps, I noticed that my recordings were dropping off from what I have saved on the DVR.  If I have 15 shows in a series saved on the DVR, only 8 or 9 may show up on the app.  

I got the runaround at Comcast (no surprise) but the consensus seems to be that my cloud storage is less than my DVR so they just ""disappear"" from what's available to me using the streaming service.

"I pay for gigabit speed, but have been getting 300mbps. I was just told by a supervisor that: 1. Comcast can not guaruntee speed if I own the modem. 2. My computer MUST be ""top of the line, i6 or better"" to get an accurate speed test. 3. 300mbps is ""fast enough""Wow....Just....Just wow....What a day I've had. I am honestly proud of myself that I didn't lose it.  Here's my story. I'm sure I'll fit in here.

I've had the gig package since February, no problems whatsoever until about 3 weeks ago when my speed dropped down to 150-250mbps. I chatted with Comcast and set up a technician to come out Thursday, however, when I got the confirmation email it said Sunday....No biggie I says to myself, I'll just reschedule. Only available date is Saturday...Okie dokie, I can do Saturday. So I set my time for Saturday between 2 and 4. 11:30 this morning a technician knocks on my door.....No problem, the house is clean, no time better than the present. 

This is when stuff really goes sideways. 

I invite the technician in and notice he has a modem in his hand. ""Oh, I purchased my own modem."" Then I get that blank stare.....Technician does not speak a word of English...I mean not a word....""No problem"" I say to myself again, my wife is fluent in Spanish. She comes out and translates for us. He was told this was an install but he can troubleshoot for me to see if he can fix the problem. He logs into my wifi, runs a speed test, gets 200mbps. He's then trying to log into the modem backend to check the diagnostics, the only problem is, the modem isn't wifi (Motorola MB8600) capable and I use google wifi which doesn't have port forwarding set up.. He's trying to figure out what to do next so I have my wife tell him I'll get my laptop and plug directly into the modem for him. So I grab my laptop and log into the modem willy nilly. He looked at the connection status and says everything looks good. Then, he just stares at me waiting for me to say ""sure, go ahead and leave"" 

I asked him next if there was anything he though might need to be done outside because the chat session rep said my lines were probably too old (8 year old house) and needed to be upgraded to fiber optic lines, to which he replied ""I don't know"" and continued to stare. I asked if he'd call his supervisor for me. He calls his supervisor who then proceeded to tell me that my modem was the problem because it was not a ""Comcast owned modem"" and that it could be my computer because it probably wasn't fast enough to get an accurate test ....My 2 month old i7-8700 laptop.......Also, that it had to be at least an ""i6 or higher"" (a processor that doesn't exist) and peppered in a ""300mbps is fast enough for most people""

At this point it's obvious nothing is going to get fixed and this dude is saying whatever he can to get me off the phone. So I tell the supervisor  ""I understand there is only so much you can do, but your answer is unacceptable. I'm going to move this up the chain, are you sure that your answer is what you want me explaining to the next tier?"" He's quiet for a few seconds then says ""I'll have the tech check the signal strength.""....""Perfect"" I replied, thanked him and handed the phone back to the tech. My wife is translating that his supervisor told him to test the signal with some tool which the tech said he didn't bring with him because this was just an installation. He went outside for 45 minutes and came back in and said he couldn't fix it, shook my hand and left. 


Isn't it sad that I'm actually relieved that at the end of a service call, I still have 1/3 of the speed I pay for each month, instead of no internet? 

TL'DR: Only getting a third of the speed I pay for, Comcast sends a tech out to tell me that's plenty.

"Paying for 150Mbps Internet in new Apartment, but barely reaches outside of living room, let alone upstairs.Hi all,

Recently moved into a new two-floor apartment, in which we have the 2nd and 3rd floors of a house. The house is older and the wiring isn't great overall, but we've just had a Comcast tech come and change the cable to be XFinity, as well as install a router.

&#x200B;

The issue is, the WiFi isn't even picked up on the 3rd floor whatsoever, and is incredibly weak outside of the living room.

&#x200B;

What options do we have? With Verizon at my old place, they gave us a free Netgear router to extend the signal upstairs, however according to Comcast chat support, they ""don't deal in extenders"".

&#x200B;

We can't run an ethernet cord upstairs as it would be a massive nuisance with the way the floor plan is laid out (staircase upstairs is small and on other side of apartment, living room is down a turning-hall way, so no straight shot for a cord).

&#x200B;

We're working on having them come back to the house to take a look again.

&#x200B;

Any advice is welcomed. Trying to stay away from buying a shitty repeater and things alike.

"Intermittent Outbound Packet LossSo I'm throwing myself upon the mercy of the r/Comcast community to try and get some help.

&#x200B;

**So a summary of my issue:**

I've had service at my current address for the past 2-3 years. For the past 3-4 weeks, I've been experiencing intermittent outbound packet loss, primarily between 9pm and 6am EDT when it's almost constant, but the issue happens throughout the day at random intervals. Spikes of up to 40% packet loss are fairly common; with the average loss over a sustained period of time being closer to 5-10% (spikes to 20-40%, then falls and maintains at 3-5% for a period of time). This is also accompanied by service degradation on a gigabit service to speeds of around 100-150Mbps down, and as little as 3 Mbps up while testing from the xfinity website. It's worth noting that I'm using PingPlotter to monitor the traceroute and latency, and the issue is between me and the first node on the network for sure. I've verified this via testing from remote PC's tracerouting back to my own modem as well. I also don't experience significantly increased latency during the periods of packet loss; however I do experience severely decreased speeds in addition to the packet loss.

&#x200B;

 

**Steps I've already taken:**

Basic Modem 101's (restart, replace, etc, etc) - I have the CGM4140COM currently, which is the 2nd modem I've experienced the issue with

I've always been hard-wired

Ensured signal strength from the modem is within spec

Contacted support numerous times, with about as much luck as you expect

Had 3 techs out; who have not had the good fortune to be here while my connection is being terrible and one of whom seems to think it may be a plant issue, but unless someone higher than them pushes say nothing will happen.

Disconnected every device connected to the modem, leaving only a single laptop running some monitoring. Issue persisted.

&#x200B;

 **What I need to know:** 

What do I do? Who the hell can I try to contact? I'm at wits end trying to do everything I can think of to get the issue resolved. At this point, I can only assume it's some form of ingress causing hell with my connection. But I'll be damned if there's anything I can do about it. Below is a snapshot of what my connection looks like on the average evening. As someone who is an avid gamer and utilized VOIP on a daily basis, this is pretty crippling to my hobbies.

\-Owning Con: No more tech support & Comcast can claim that our equipment is causing problems should they arise

\-Renting Con: Comcast can throttle speeds by sending a code to the equipment

\-Renting Pro: We can get a free annual equipment upgrade (though this equipment may still be inferior to purchased equipment - right?)

"Outage RageSo, had an outage of my Comcast Business Internet this afternoon.  The building power went out briefly at the same time, so I strongly suspected some outside failure - backhoe, car crashing into a pole, etc.  Modem came back up but without the connection lights.  Called in to report the outage, went through the phone tree, including no less than 4 minutes' worth of shouting ""NO!"" at ""You have a past due of $$$"" prompts that I totally didn't care about - that's Accounts Payable, not IT.  I eventually get on with an agent, report the problem, reset my modem again just to comply with their script, etc.  The agent was in the middle of scheduling a tech call-out when it came up on her screen that my problem was due to a larger outage (as expected).

So far, no problem - it's annoying, but it happens when you've got physical infrastructure exposed to the crazy public.

So, the agent gets to the point in the script that I was actually calling about - getting my phone into their system so I can receive updates as the problem is resolved.  The agent takes my number and gives a little spiel about possible data charges for SMS, etc.  Everything sounded good.

Except I never got any update.  Some time passed and eventually it came back up.  Not a single update, not even a ""it's fixed"" message.

At no point was I able to keep management in the loop about possible timing - this was of course affecting business for the day and management (reasonably) wanted if not an immediate fix, at least some possible estimates.  And I was unable to give them anything.

This is the fourth outage in the past year and a half, which in terms of uptime actually isn't too bad.  And outages are always going to occur as long as we're dealing with public infrastructure.  And, in this case, it was only down for an hour or so, which is worth giving props for being on top of things.

But in every case, no updates.  One of the previous outages was over 16 hours, and at no point did we have any indication of whether it was going to be another 5 minutes or several days.  Which of course made for some pissy managers unable to plan for the day and without the information that they need on whether they need to make alternate plans.

Seriously Comcast?  You have a system in place for this.  You keep close tracking of your dispatch techs every step of the way so they can barely hit the restroom without it being logged.  And you claim that the customer can get in on that tracking as well.  Except that it just plain never works.

Random service outages are one thing, but failing on your own promised communication methods is simply unacceptable.

This latest outage has prompted some management-level interest in researching redundant internet connections.  I fully expect that we can get a better deal on our redundant line and be able to drop our Comcast service down to a lower speed/priced package and consider Comcast to tbe our backup instead of our primary.",0

Would the latter provide a stronger signal? Sorry if this sounds dumb. I'm just trying to figure this out before buying cables. Thank you!",0
"Comcast has gotten screwing customers down to a science.TL;DR - When Comcast surprises you with a rate increase, they carefully collect data on what surprise price increase will result in cancelations vs just complaints. Screwing customers is an integral, well thought out part of their strategy.

I signed up in August last year for 100 Mbps @ $39.99 (internet service only). In January I get an email saying:

""Hold on tight. We've increased your Internet speed. We're on a mission to improve your experience, and that means making sure you have the Internet speeds you need to save time and do more of what you love. That's why we've increased your speed from 100 Mbps to 150 Mbps **at no extra cost to you**. So, go ahead – simply restart your modem to enjoy your new speed."" (bolded by me for emphasis)

August rolls around and my bill goes up to $54.99, and sure enough, they are charging me $39.99 plus $14.99 for the speed boost. I call to ask why the price went up when they said it would be at no cost to me, and the rep says that I signed up in August for the Performance Pro package when I initiated service and refused to remove the charge. Honestly, I felt bad for the poor call center rep that is being incentivized to basically lie to people, so I made a point of being polite at all times. It took me quoting the original confirmation email, then the January email, before she gave up on that story and switched to trying to find another promotion I could sign up for, saying she can do 60 Mbps @ $39.99 plus I get a month of some streaming service.

I get that for some people, it's worth playing these games every once in a while to get fast internet at as low a price as possible. That's just not the case for me - so I canceled the service and switched to Sonic DSL, where I'm paying $39.99 for 20Mbps, because honestly, having to figure out how Comcast is going to screw me and keep on top of that is more than I care to deal with. Have always had great experiences with Sonic in the past and am willing to take the speed hit not to have to deal with Comcast. Maybe if AT&T Fiber expands to my area I'll roll the dice on that.

Comcast then hits me with an automated survey through three different channels where the first option given for why you canceled (after they figure out that you didn't move) is:

""The monthly fee on your service was increasing or has increased.""

When you select that, the next question is:

""What was the amount of the monthly increase?""

So basically they are testing out what level of price increase they can get away with, and using the ""Customer Satisfaction"" survey to do that. I didn't even have a particularly horrible experience from a customer service perspective - the big realization for me was that misleading and mistreating customers is actually an integral part of how Comcast does business. It's not just bad PR, or bad support - they take a zero sum view towards their customers, and are scientific in their approach to screwing you over. There are dozens, if not hundreds of people at Comcast who explicitly designed and executed this strategy, and thousands more who know about it and are complicit. This is the danger of monopoly power, and unchecked corporate greed.",0

We found a deal that worked for us and was offered for only 5 dollars more than the amount of our old bill. When the bill came it was just under 20 dollars higher than advertised. We do not rent anything from Comcast and canceled the bullshit streampix auto enrollment a long time ago, there's nothing extra that's adding charges.

I asked my girlfriend who went with me what she remembered hearing for the price and it was the same amount that I remember hearing. When I signed the electronic pad I didn't see anything telling me the total price agreement so I'm guessing we were lied to in order to make a sale.

I've called customer support and was told there's nothing they can do to reduce the price. Also the new bill came around the same time as the 30 day mark so I can't cancel without an early termination fee. I might try going back to the same store that I signed up at but I have nothing to show I was misled.

I've gotten a lot of google hits about people complaining of the same thing happening but didn't find much about going about resolving the issue. Any advice?",0
"One call, 4 different answersIn July, after my bill doubled at the end of the contract, I discontinued the TV service and reduced my speed to 60mbs (from 150). I opted for the no-games ""just give me a price without surprises"" option of 60mbs for 66.95/mo. Fast forward to this week, I got a promo listing that speed + TV for $49.95, so I checked online to see the offers (competitor fiber is a year away for my neighborhood).

Online, it shows that my current service (unspecified) is $84/mo. So I call (after Googling their contact number, since they make it hard to find). I'm told that I have 150mbs service. I explain I signed up for the 60mbs service and I'm told, ""no you are on 150mbs plan."" I press the point and am told, I'm on the 150 plan with customer retention discount. I counter that I am not even getting half of that (did Speedtest.net while on the phone). Then I'm told I've got the 75mbs plan (not even listed on their site). We go back and forth some more, I ask to speak with a supervisor or manager, I get the runaround, we go back and forth and I again press to speak with a manager (not taking no for an answer).

Manager comes on and tells me I'm on the 65mbs plan with customer retention discount. I ask for price confirmation and whether it's a limited-time promo or a regular price I can count on. Manager confirms it's not a promo, but a regular rate. So, after nearly 30 minutes, I did at least confirm something I thought I already knew before I called, at least there's that...

I thought I might upgrade, including buying a new modem, since they say that I may not get full speeds with my existing one (never had problems before, but maybe that's why 60bms — er, 65mbs — feels much slower than that and latency is high). Before dealing with them online and by phone, I was 90% decided to get a new cable modem, but now I wonder if I should just switch to Sonic Internet, since I've heard good things about them, even though they only offer up to 30mbs in my area (4,200 feet from CO). I shudder at moving back to DSL, but Comcast is just so frustrating to deal with — they don't even put the speed of the internet I'm paying for on the bills. I also detest their anti-competitive practices, the way they give their existing customers worse deals than new customers and on and on.

"Comcast Business account ""flagged for High Bandwidth Usage""Received this email today.. I'm a business class user (since January 2014) specifically because I didn't want the hassle of data caps. Seems like they're trying to bully me into paying more?? It's my understanding that I can't even monitor my usage (without using 3rd-party services) specifically because business class = no usage limits. So what gives? I responded and basically said as much (I chose business class for my home office in part for no bandwidth restrictions, there is no limit per this (a Comcast) URL, I'm happy to discuss it if you show me a written policy stating as much and I can't afford to and don't want to pay more than I already am). Now I'm kind of afraid I kicked the hornet's nest so to speak, as I was rather firm (though polite enough).. Thoughts?? I've considered switching to another provider anyway, but am stuck in the contract here until around this time next year (maybe another reason they want to push something on me now..?). I'm pissed. Here's the email:


Hi [Maggiethecat33],

I just wanted to touch base with you regarding your internet service because your account has been flagged for High Bandwidth Usage.

As your Account Manager I am reaching out to ensure that you are set up correctly and that our services are meeting your business needs.

The current Internet tier you are running on does not appear to be enough Mbps for the number of devices at any given time.

We can triple your speed for $30.00 more per month…less than $1.00 a day.

Please let me know if this is something you are interested in looking into.

Kind Regards,

"How I got the $10 HD tech fee taken off my bill for 2 years.Last month, I upgraded my basic non-hd tv service (usually just stream netflix/amazon) to the HD standard version. I had a cable box that had HDMI and was capable of HD service. I talked with tech support for over an hour asking why the HDMI port wasn't outputting anything and after an hour they told me I didn't have the $10/m HD Technology Fee and that it would cost me $10 more a month to actually watch the HD that my package came with.

So I field an FCC complaint: https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us

1 day later I got a call from comcast and explained the ""bait and switch"", where I purchased an HD package, but I'm unable to actually watch ""HD"" without paying more than the advertised rate. She told me that her manager has authorized her to give me for a special promotion, 2 years of no HD Technology fee. 

YMMV, but I think more people should file FCC complaints over bogus fees.

"Choppy Video Playback Streaming OnDemand on ChromebookI've been successfully streaming OnDemand shows from Xfinity on my Chromebook for many months. A few days ago, I think my Chromebook did an update of Chrome; since then, all the shows I try to stream end up with perfect audio but the video briefly freezes every few seconds (like missing every 6th heartbeat or something). 

Other streaming, like YouTube or Netflix, still stream fine on my Chromebook, and Xfinity streams fine on Chrome on my Wintel laptop, so the only choppy video is Xfinity on my Chromebook. Have restarted the Chromebook; no change. Have searched for solutions online, but no luck.

Any ideas? Is this something that a tech at Comcast would help with over the phone, or would they just say that the problem is my Chromebook and not their problem?  Thanks, folks!

1. Stay w/Xfin home: $60/mo for 60/5Mb and hope the 2 free months per year over 1TB will be enough.

"Good Tech; Terrible ComcastLately I've had some trouble with my internet going in and out.  I got my own modem and router long ago after realizing how terrible the supplied 2in1 modem is.  I've called Comcast a couple times about this problem and they were absolutely no help.  Finally last Tuesday I talked to a rep and after I explained that the upstream reading is really high at 57 he agreed to do a check on their readings.  He says they are coming back as red, so i'm assuming poor.  We schedule a tech visit for this Saturday.  

Saturday rolls around and we are still having internet problems.  The tech shows up during his time frame and immediately gets to work.  He verifies the abnormally high upstream readings, then proceeds to remove a couple splitters that weren't being used.  Unfortunately this doesn't do anything so he goes outside to check the line.  He finds a line that was marked by Comcast a couple weeks ago for causing interference with the other lines in the area.  AKA this line was the source of my problem and comcast knew that it was causing problems for customers but ignored it.  The tech promptly fixed it, and I have had no problems since then.  My upsteam readings are also at a nice healthy 42.1 dba.

"Comcast treating existing customers unfairly, giving much better deals to new customers while bullying with ETFee to keep customer by force unhappyI renewed my Internet service contract with Comcast \~July this year  taking ""Internet Performance Basic"" (15Mbps) plan for 1y for $29.99/month. Before this I had better plan for previous 1y called ""Performance Plus"" (60Mbps) and  when today I went to xfinity.com to check offers and prices they offer  ""Performance Plus"" for $29.99/m, but when I called Comcast asking if I can switch to it (and renew contract, which I they used to do few times in the  past with no problem as that keeps customers treated fairly and keeps/RETAINS them), now they tell me that for existing  customers they only offer $44.99/m for ""Performance Plus"" and this  $29.99/m is only for ""off the street"" new/stranger customers. This was confirmed by manager/supervisor too multiple times while talking to ""customer retention department"". So, I expressed my  dissatisfaction with such practice stating that I see this as DISCRIMINATION against me as a current customer over the new customers and stated that then their department now should not be called ""retention"" but ""deterrent"" as that is the ultimate outcome. In the light of this, I wanted to leave but they remind me that I am ""hooked"" and would  need to pay ""early termination fee"" $10/m (which would translate to \~11  months). They said that is what contract has written (although these contracts are overly long and not written to be understood in detail by anybody who is not lawyer. All in all, on paper company can write any gaming scheme that is not ultimately fair and we as customers would have to fight for fairness (remind them what retention and fairness means, to treat existing customers better or at minimum equal as outside/new customers and remind them that this applies universally to every collective from family to company to state to humankind and wider).

I see this practice of ""big companies"" behaviour as quite dishonest and ""playing with small-print games"", ultimately all rigged against interests  of us customers creating very unhealthy market where all customers are  subjects for manipulation and rip off's bit by bit.

I'm a brand new customer of Comcast (of only 2 weeks) and have a question. I recently changed from a ""Quad Play"" to a ""Double Play"" pkg on 8/31 that now includes/adds Starz free for 2 years that I did not have before. Does that include Starz Encore as well? I was told by a customer service supervisor that the Starz TV pkg does NOT include any Starz Encore channels. It's only included in a higher TV pkg (I have the 140 channel pkg).

The weird part is that when I filter my DVR on my main TV to show ""Free to Me,"" (in other words the guide ONLY shows channels that I am subscribing to/paying for), but when I view the guide, it shows the Starz channels AND Starz Encore listed. 

In addition, I CAN watch ALL the On Demand for Starz Encore, but just can't watch any Starz Encore channels on live TV on the main DVR cable box. Why is that? 

On top of that, I use the Stream app thru a Roku for a 2nd TV, and I CAN watch Starz Encore on this TV (live TV) and also all the On Demand. I just can't watch Starz Encore live on the main DVR box.

Does Starz include Starz Encore as well? If not, why am I am able to watch the Starz Encore On Demand  on both TV's AND live Starz Encore channels on the Roku App?

Called today to cancel my land line, Was told the best they could do was that $71.99 and I told them about the chat I had with the rep.

I tried to explain to them, why would I agree to cancel my home phone so my Internet could go up, that makes no sense. The worst part is the town I live in is only serviced by Comcast for internet.

So I proceed to tell them I will be sending the phone back, A 1000 dollar purchase, I will be disconnecting both the phone and Internet, and My room mate goes to college and will just get the Internet, for the introduction price of $39.99 for 2 years.

They went on to claim that would be fraud, And I explained nicely what their mobile rep did was bait and switch. He promised me another price, that would be lower then the $71.

One last question, we had Comcast a long time ago and I'm not sure if our house is still cable ready for internet. How could we find out without the need for a technician. I'd rather do it myself than pay for them to come out and set it up. Self-install kit is pretty awesome.

"What just happened to my service?!Hello,

I can 100% confirm that my service was working 24 hours ago - actually less than that because of when I left for work in the morning. Sometime between me leaving for work and noon, service dropped - without explanation. My parents we're home all day and got the screen shot below - what causes this?! 

My mother spoke with 'tech support' twice. I was told they sent something to reboot the router and give it 10 minutes (why the tech hung up without resolution is another question). Over the phone I walked her through rebooting the router and can verify it was back up (logging into the router again and seeing the Wifi networks, there's still no WAN address). She then called 'tech support' again and was told Comcast can't communicate with my modem yet she still got this screen attached.

I googled welcome to Xfinity and got nothing of any revelance. I am not aware of any service changes in the area and own the modem. Is there any easy way to fix this without calling 'tech support':?!

Thanks in advance!

"Help choosing internet plan.I'm soon moving into a house with five other people (college students), and I'm trying to decide which internet plan would be the most suitable for our situation. The six of us all have smartphones and laptops, and maybe four us will have a gaming console. We will likely stream things like Netflix/Hulu, possibly all of us at once sometimes. 

I will be getting Comcast Xfinity, and they are offering plans with speeds of (up to) 60 Mbps, 150 Mbps, 250 Mbps, or 400 Mbps. I've been leaning toward either the 60 Mbps or 150 Mbps, but I'm looking for any recommendations on which of these plans seem most appropriate for our household. 

Also, we currently do not have our own router or modem to use, so I will probably opt to rent Xfinity's xFi Gateway router/modem combo for an additional $11/month. Should this perform well enough for the price? Or are we better off getting our own router and modem?

"Xfinity Website ""My Account"" Page Showing Fees Lower than What's Being BilledCheck your bill against their website. They are billing more for taxes and fees than their site says they are. It's only a few dollars, but it adds up for them, and their customer service is terrible.

If you go to [Your XFINITY Plan](https://www.xfinity.com/buy/plan/myplan), it lists all of the various fees and taxes they charge.  I compared these values to my bill, and they are charging more than 6 dollars more than their site says I owe. Based on the fees they currently say I owe, They've over-billed me almost $45 in the past year.  I tried to get it refunded, but they refuse to acknowledge my point.  They should be required to honor the lowest price they quote.  It might not be much money for each individual, but it adds up for them.  I'm sure a lawyer would love to get them with a class action suit for all of their customers.

"Had cable on my lawn for 3 months, complained to FCC - resolved same dayI got xfinity because there was no other option in my area.

Ordered  it late May around 5/20 and had trouble right away. The connection to  the house wasn't working, so I had to have a tech come out, he missed  his appointment so I got $20 for that (had to call 4 people and  eventually just tweeted to them to get the money).

​

I  HIGHLY recommend dealing with them through Twitter as it's the easiest  and fastest way to get them to respond and you deal with them on your  time not by staying on-hold, however you are not dealing with your local  branch and some distant (probably overseas) customer rep area.

​

So  finally tech comes out and states my underground line is no good, he  will run a temporary line and have work scheduled to put in a permanent  underground line (I recommend underground line as no trees can snap it  and generally it's more weather proof and reliable). Seems there was no  room for my connection on the pole so he disconnected my neighbor, which  we had a good laugh at with my neighbor at how dumb Comcast is.

​

Comcast  charges me $50 install fee despite me plugging in my router/modem  myself, after lengthy tweets they reversed these charges after I showed  them a screenshot where they said I won't be charged.

​

Over  the next 3 months the temporary line is laying on my lawn, I have to  pick it up to mow, the mailman tripped over it. The third party cable  company laid my cable down within the month but never told Comcast. So  for 3 months I tweet Comcast every now and then, finally getting sick of  it I start tweeting and looking for updates daily.

​

Finally  I warn them I will complain to the FCC, and again they apologize but  don't do shit. I give them 3 days and still nothing is done so at work I  file an FCC complaint and submit a 42 page word document with all  Comcast/My tweets. I tell Comcast I have done this, and wish them good  luck. A few hours later they schedule a tech to come out and check the  situation, he comes out snips the temp line and connects underground  line in under 30 minutes. I give him cold water and thank him. DONE. I  tell Comcast the situation is resolved and thank them.

​

For  the last week techs have been coming to see me, I have been getting  calls asking me if I need help, and now a Comcast Exec has left me a  voicemail saying he wants to learn more about my situation. LOL

Line into building is elevated so they need a truck with a cherry picker to get up to replace line.

* Tech examines issues and says, yep, issue with the line and they need to schedule to send a line crew to fix/replace line
* No confirmation of crew every being assigned/sent
* Back to square one

I did get a phone number for corporate Comcast once and spoke with someone who scheduled a line person to come out and do the work.  He then called me and said he needed prior approval from building management to do the work at the building.  Management company called him and gave direct authorization.

"Currently on basic cable + Internet package- where to go from here?I'm in Western PA and recently found out Gigabit is available in my location. I'm potentially looking at upgrading my Internet speed from the 250 Mbps tier to possibly 400 Mbps or 1 Gbps.

Right now I've only got Limited Basic TV Service 30+ channels ($17.99) and Blast! Internet ($79.95) so after fees and taxes it is $107 with no contract prices or anything.  When I try to pick any plans online it only gives me triple play bundles with higher TV tiers + Internet + phone;  unless I want to pay $299.99 a month for 2 Gbps (which I do not) and that is the only Internet only package being offered.

I absolutely do not want phone service, at all.  So I decided to chat with a Comcast rep online seeing how much it would cost to just upgrade the Internet speed. He told me I had a legacy ""a la carte"" plan and literally the only options available were to do the triple play bundles.  I haven't looked into it further but decided to post here on Reddit.  I'd be open to getting more TV channels if I could do a decent bundle with 250 Mbps / 400 Mbps or 1000 Mbps Internet and that's it.  Or just keep TV the same and upgrade Internet.

I found the UPnP “device discovery” setting in the configuration and thought that was causing the issue, but even with it disabled, my connection will always drop right when the clock goes from XX:59 to XY:00.


Can someone please explain what is scheduled to drop my connection and help me fix this? Thank you!

EDIT: I added the correct flair.


I also wanted to mention that nothing shows in the logs, they appear to be empty. Is there a way to turn up the logging level when this happens?",0

"Switching from comcast business to xfinityHey guys, I've had comcast business for over two years and I'm currently in the process of switching to xfinity. Current speeds are 25mbps with business so I'm planning to switch to 250mbps. My question is, could my current setup up hand the speeds or would I need tp upgrade? What I've been using so far, SB6190 with the 300Mbps Wireless N Router. I know its a cheap set up so thats why I wanted to ask. Also, since I'll be using my own equipment, I should be able to save $10 on my bill, correct? Thank you",0
"Comcast Tech Refused to Use Purchased EquipmentMy girlfriend and I are moving and getting Comcast Internet. In preparation, she went ahead and bought a modem from Comcast's list of compatible devices and then bought a nice router. But when the technician came by today for the installation, he refused to use any of her purchased equipment. He explained that he didn't feel comfortable working with a router owned by the customer because he had broken several in the past and had to pay for them.

So, what does Mr. Router-Breaker decide is the best course of action? He set up a nice Comcast gateway for her Internet service, explaining that now there will be an extra $11/month rental fee since she's renting her equipment from Comcast. We're going to a physical Xfinity location soon to see if we can get this ironed out, but I was at a loss for words when she told me.",0

"Comcast doubled my internet and reduced the price for meA few weeks ago I called comcast to get the lowdown on my package price because my 12 month term is ending this month. They said the package would go from $60 a month to $90 a month because the deal only lasted for 12 months. I  tried my best to talk the price down but they would not budge! So I just accepted it and ended the call.

Flash forward today and a customer service contractor called me asking how my experience was talking to comcast. I said I just wanted to see if I could get the bill lowered and I was disappointed that I was not able to. The kind woman on the phone transferred me to a Comcast service rep and he cut the TV plan, cut HBO, and then doubled my internet from 55mbs to 150mbs for only about $6 a month after my original 12 month contract bill of $60 a month. Now I can say I am pleased with comcast!

 So the next year I am going to be paying $66 a month instead of $90!",0

"Problem switching name of utilityHey folks - 

So about two years ago, I moved into an apartment with a group of people and put the internet utility in my name. When I moved out a few months later, I went to the online portal and switched the name of the utility to another one of the housemates. For months afterwards though, I received calls from Comcast asking me about my service. When I told the caller I no longer lived at this residence, they told me the utility was still in my name. I've been contacting the current residents for about a year now trying to get them to go to the Comcast center and change it to their name. I tried contacting Comcast to get them to cancel the service or change the name of the utility payer, and they said I had to go to the service center with my legal ID. The current residents won't answer my phone calls, texts, or facebook messages. What do I do? I'm worried an unknown late payment will affect my credit score. ",0

"Have a technician coming over today and I'm looking for advice!I have had a recurring problem for about 2-3 years now where every couple of months or maybe even weeks, a consistent series of micro-disconnections start happening for a time (would last anywhere for days to months, and would happen as consistently as a couple minutes apart to hours).  However up until now I have never scheduled a technician to come by in fear that whenever it Does reappear that a technician would simply swing by and the ""wave"" would have passed where there was nothing but a clear connection by the time the scheduled visit would have been.

The only thing i will note is I do run a 100ft cat6 ethernet from my first floor to my upstairs room, however I happen to play alot of mobile games and notice that when I do receive micro-disconnections it affects both my wifi and computers downstairs right next to my router/modem.  At this point my scheduled visit is anywhere from 2-4 hours and I was wondering if anyone has some advice as to what I can do to point out a specific problem to a technician who probably won't be able to care enough a micro-disconnection that to any person watching youtube all day wouldn't notice, but to me who watches and tries to livestream consistently gets disconnected from games and such livestreaming services.

"Anyone else internet bill increase?We were paying $59.99 per month and now it has increased to $65.96.

We were paying $59.99 for at least a year and a half until my Dad decided to get buy a modem, this dropped our monthly bill to $45~  last year from June and July, but after those two months the price went back up to $59.99.

We are on Internet: Performance Plus ($44.34) + Blast! Pro Internet ($21.62)

1.) How much are you guys paying for internet + what package?

2.) Did any of your internet bills increased recently?

3.) Any of you guys recalled how much you're paying for the Comcast modem and if your bill increased some months after buying a modem of your own?

4.) Should I call Comcast support and ask them to reduce it back to $59.99? (it also looks like a nicer number to write on the check and the good news is that the bill states that we are saving $33.06 a month!)",0
"Bait and Switch?I am canceling my TV and only keep Blast.

I get an offer to get it for a year for $49.99 a month but, when I get the contract, it reads that I am signing up for Performance and that I am being upgraded for free to Performance Plus/Blast.

I asked why the mention of Performance Plus instead of just Blast and all I hear in reply is that I’ll continue to get Blast speed.

So I ask to put that in the contract because, I assume, Performance Plus isn’t as fast and, in the event I’m not hitting 150 Mbps, Comcast can say they only have to maintain Plus speeds.

Is Plus and Blast the same speeds? I didn’t think so so why have that in the contract?

I’d hate to cancel but this doesn’t smell right to me. Thoughts?",0

I've never heard of Comcast selling services without any sort of annual agreement. Maybe this is just the plan price without the contract?",0

"Help finding voice capable modem/routerI just added internet and phone to my TV plan and am now on a triple play plan with 150 Mbps internet. I told Comcast I would be using my own modem and router, so I'll need to find something quickly before the tech comes by in a few days for installation.

I've been looking at the list of compatible equipment, but I'm a bit overwhelmed. Since I have a voice plan, I'm assuming the router/modem needs to have voice capabilities? Can some one give me a hand? 

Ideally, I would be able to Amazon Prime the equipment, but as a last resort I can make a call and have them add rental and deal with cancelling it when I do figure out my own equipment...",0

"Roommate was told by Comcast the only way to secure a $79.95 a month rate for ""Blast"" was to include a TV package. About to call and renegotiate for her. Advice?So I just found out my roommate has been paying $116.49 a month for our ""Blast!"" internet package. This includes the 'great' rate of $79.95 a month for the package itself, plus a total of $24.80 a month for a ""basic"" TV package she was told she MUST include to get the ""great"" internet rate. (Breaks down to $16 for basic TV, $7.50 for a ""broadcast tv fee"" and $1.30 for ""franchise fee.)

Needless to say I am pissed beyond belief. I'm about to call up Comcast and ask to speak to retention and demand a lower rate. Any advice on the best way to negotiate this?

*EDIT* - After the first person in retention kept insisting there were NO options without a package and the best renegotiation would be a package that would cost like $2 less a month, I called back and spoke to a second rep. Negotiated to an internet only package that, with modem rental fee, comes to less than $90 a month. That's basically what we were already paying without all the TV charges. I also got a $60 credit put on the account.",0

Xi5 box with non Comcast rented modemSo I just signed up with Comcast today and when I was on the phone with the guy setting up my account I requested to have the wireless boxes installed. He said that was not an issue and made a note of it. I then asked him if I had to have there modem for those to work properly and he said no I would not. Now I was just doing some late night googling like I do when I’m bored and came across multiple sources on Comcast’s support saying for the wireless boxes you DO need to have there modem. I was hoping someone could shed some light on this for me. Do I need to have there modem? Or will mine work?

"Please Help a Lonely Soldier Fight an Unholy WarForeward: The following has taken place over 29 calls on my cellphone, and an unknown number from my computer, I have never yelled at any agent I have talked to and have been very gracious that they are taking the time to help me with my problem.

June 14th, 2018 - Called into Comcast, spoke with Jermon Raymond who went by ""Darnell"", he quoted me a package for

-Gigabit Internet
-Starter Channel Package
-All of the premium channels (starz, hbo, cinemax, etc) included for free
-An HD DVR Box and an HD receiver for our 2 TV's
-Half Price Installation
-Locked pricing for 24 months

for a price of $110.00 pre-tax (approximately $130 post tax)

June 16th, 2018 - Reached out to Jermon to get everything finalized and get a contract written up, never got a response

June 19th, 2018 - Reached out to Jermon again letting him know that if wanted his commission I would wait for him, but I needed to get this finalized in the next day or 2. I received a response and I signed the customer consent form for the exact package he quoted me initially. I checked this line by line and everything was correct; I was then told that I would receive a copy of the contract in my email which never happened, not to my email, the account holder's email, or the new Xfinity email. We scheduled an install date of July 21st between 1:00pm and 3:00pm

July 21st 2018 - Technicians showed up on site at 2:00pm and reviewed the work order with me; they said they were there to install gigabit internet and 1 non-DVR television box that only supported standard definition. I informed them that a mistake had been made somewhere on their end so they called back in to the office and tried to get everything sorted out. The ""fix"" that was offered to us was to add all of the items that I had signed up for and to charge me $185 / month instead of the original $110 I had signed the contract for. This was obviously unacceptable so we ended up postponing the install until I sorted everything out.

3:00 pm - Called in to the no-wait hotline and explained the situation to a woman who's name I did not catch, I gave her the information required to pull the phone recording of the initial conversation with Jermon in order to set this straight; she did not even acknowledge this as an option and then she then transferred me to a sales rep named Jessica who essentially told me there was nothing she could do and that she would be transferring me to an escalation agent. After being on hold quite a while, I was informed that they were busy and would call me back by 5:00pm at the absolute latest.

5:30 pm - Never received a call from the escalation tech, was starting to get worried so I called back in to the no-wait hotline and spoke to a rep named Sean. Sean told me that there was no ticket ever created to call me back, nor were there any notes in my account to do so. I explained my situation to him and he was able to get me close to what I was originally quoted ($139.89 / month), which frankly is still unacceptable after I had already signed a contract, but I was so fed up with everything I said whatever. He then sent me another contract which I signed and have a copy of and set an install date of July 30th, but he was going to put a ticket in for installation ASAP. I figured we were out of the woods, but then he was having problems rescheduling the install due to the original work order not being completed. He ended up having to call me back as he could not figure out how to accomplish what he was trying to do in the system without a supervisor.

6:30 pm - Sean called me back to inform me that he was still working through the problem and he would be in touch later that night.

8:00 pm - Sean called back again to say that he could not make the system do what he needed it to do in order to schedule the job so I would receive a call from one of the escalation reps within the next 2 days. I verified again at this point that there would be no issue with the contract and as soon as they figured out how to get it scheduled we would be on our way, which he confirmed across the board. He also stated that I would be receiving a free installation due to excessive amount of trouble I was having.

July 22nd, 2018 - The escalation rep, named Gale, called me at 3:30pm and started to question what I was trying to do with this ticket, he then said that he couldn't figure out how to add codes to the account to get the price down (I'm not sure why he was messing with this at all). After I told him all I needed was for the job to be scheduled he told me that he couldn't figure out the price stuff so, ""I'm going to have to pay more"", which was just mind-boggling. I told him that was not going to work, and that they would need to figure out a solution. He told me that I would be hearing from him soon and offered to send me his contact information, I agreed and gave him my e-mail. I never received the aforementioned contact information, nor a call.

July 23rd, 2018 - 8:00pm Spoke with a rep named Javier; he ran into an issue getting promo codes to work, he's getting an error saying that the promotion is not valid with the equipment on the account. He thinks it is because the installation was postponed and there no equipment on on site. I requested to have the ticket reassigned from Gale (the executive care relations rep) due to a lack of confidence in his ability to get the job done. Javier has put a note in his calendar to follow up on the ticket on July 24th and collaborate with Sean as well. Javier e-mailed all executive care relations supervisors in order to get this taken care of as quickly as possible, he also noted that our AT&T Contract expires on the 27th of July and stated that the executive care reps should be able to get the install taken care of ASAP as they have more power to adjust the installation techs' schedules

July 24th, 2018 - Did not hear from Javi by 12:00 pm so I called back in to the ONIT number and got in touch with him, he managed to setup an installation appointment for the 24th of July (today) for 5:00pm - 7:00pm and assured me that once the equipment was installed that he would be able to enter the promotional codes to get my price back down to the price I had previously agreed to on the customer consent form and any additional charges would be refunded.

I received a call from the dispatch agent, Al, later in the day (approximately 3:00pm) informing me that he knew that this was a massive problem ticket and assuring me that there would be no issue, the tech knew it was an install job, and that he would be there as soon as possible.

5:15 - I received a text stating that the technician had arrived, which I thought was odd as I was standing in my garage waiting for him. Shortly after, I received an automated phone call stating that I should go out and meet the technician as he was looking for me, obviously, he was not there. I called the ONIT line again to let them know what was going on in hopes of them reaching the technician, the rep I spoke to said that there was nothing that she could do as they don't have a contact number for dispatch, she made a ticket and told me she would call back. About 10 minutes later I received another automated call informing me that the technician had left the site and that my appointment was cancelled. I thought it was very odd that he never called me to get my location, or that he couldn't find the house in the first place as the technician who was scheduled to do the initial install had no problem and there is no issue finding my residence on google maps. Immediately after, I called the ONIT line and requested to speak to Sean or Javi to inform them of what happened; I was transferred to Sean who could not believe what happened. He, again, apologized profusely for the utterly abysmal service I had been receiving and promptly submitted another ticket informing dispatch that the tech was to complete an install for 2 tv's and the internet and then proceeded to schedule another appointment for July 25th (tomorrow) at 1:00pm - 3:00pm as I told him I would stay home from work that day. He also told me that even if the work order was incorrect, to allow the tech to install the equipment at the higher price and he would manually credit the account each month until a permanent solution was found (this was approved by his manager and is noted in the account). I thanked him again for his continued determination and asked to speak to his manager. Sean transferred me to his manager who's name I believe was Kyle, and I proceeded to tell him what an awful experience this whole process had been, but informed him that Javi and Sean are all-star employees and are the only reason I had not given up and just cancelled my account.

July 25th, 2018 - Technician (Preston Wilson) showed up on site at approximately 1:30pm, met him in the driveway and we exchanged information. He told me that he was there on a support call, not an installation call, and that he didn't have time to complete an installation. I asked him to call dispatch and try to get things straightened out while I called the ONIT line again and tried to work through that avenue. ONIT, again, told me that they did not have a direct line with dispatch, but that they did see that the ticket that was sent to them did indeed mention that it was for an install and not a support call. After I got off the phone with ONIT, I spoke with the tech who said his dispatcher (Nick) told him that there was nothing he could do and to just leave. I told the tech that this was completely unacceptable as this was the 3rd time they were on site for a routine install and that he would more than likely be losing a customer if he just left without resolving anything, he didn't care at all and just left. I called ONIT again and got in touch with Javi and explained what happened. Again, he could not believe what had happened; he said he was going to dig into it and get back to me. At this point I was at my wit's end with the amount of incompetence I had been subjected to and began tweeting at Comcast / Xfinity as well as posting on their facebook wall. While I was in the midst of this I received a call from Gale (the first since when he told me that, ""I was just going to have to pay more""); Gale told me he had been working on my ticket the past few days, when I had inquired as to why I hadn't heard from him at all he said that he had other customers he had to deal with. It was at this point I told him that I knew he was lying as Javi and Sean had informed me that he had been out of office as they too, had been trying to get in touch with him, he told me that he had a ""Family Emergency"" and never even apologized for lying to me. I then asked him why he had never sent over his contact information after he had offered it to me, he said he had, and I told him to go back and look at his sent emails, at which point he acknowledged that he had not ever sent them to me. Gale offered me another flimsy promise of him being there ready to take care of it and make sure it worked out next time, he had cancelled the account I had been working with and that had all of my ticket information and notes in it and had created a new one for me, following this, his solution to my problem was an installation date of August 1st, which I told him was not going to be acceptable as my AT&T contract was expiring on the 27th of July and that I would be without any service at all. Just to note, I scheduled the initial install for the 21st of July just in case there were any bumps in the road that might delay the setup process and had made it crystal clear to Comcast that I absolutely needed to be up and running by then, to which they assured me would absolutely not be an issue. Well, Gale didn't think that was important and told me there was nothing he could do and I would just have to live with August 1st. I was furious at point and told him to schedule it as a backup, but I would be getting it changed. During the phone call with Gale, I was also speaking with the social media agents; nothing noteworthy was said as they could not comprehend the situation and refused to call me to get it sorted out. They offered me free HBO for 24 months and a free install as compensation, to which I replied that I had already been promised that. After I got off the phone with Gale, I found the number for the Comcast corporate HQ and called them up. I explained my situation to the man who answered, he was taken aback when every piece of advice he offered me was met with a defeated, ""Yea, I already tried that."" After he exhausted every suggestion he could give me, he told me, to my dismay, that Gale was the most powerful person in this whole situation and when I explained how unreliable he had been, he suggested that I submit a report to the Better Business Bureau as incidents raised by them must be resolved within 2 days (which is where this novel is headed). After getting off the phone with corporate, I got in touch with Javi again, who told me, contrary to Gale, that he would get a ticket into dispatch to get another early install and that I would be hearing back from somebody by 9:30pm today at the latest. It is 9:10pm as of writing this update and I have not heard back, nor do I expect to. I will be continuing this unholy war as I have been, any updates from myself will be available upon request.",0
"Hooray! The Comcast Witch Is Dead!I was a loyal Comcast customer for 16 years.  During that time, I spent $38,400  as their customer.  Then they decided to start charging overage fees.  They claimed that they warned, us, and they may very well have, but we never saw the warnings.  They charged us over $400 in overages for using what they termed was too much data.

When I called to find out what was going on, they refused to help me.  They said that in addition to warning us, they had already waived the overage charges once.  Again, something that could very well be true, but given the lack of communication, we had no idea.

It's all good Comcast!  Because I just dumped you!!  And guess what; I am getting 100 times the speed (10 gigs up and down) for 1/8th the monthly cost ($25 a month).  

Life's a bitch when your competitor is a fiber optic network...

Perhaps next time don't treat a loyal customer so badly... or do... I really don't care, because though I don't hold a grudge, I have no incentive to ever come back.  You see, your refusal to credit me $400 woke me up and got me to research your competitors, and to discover that I can get a SIGNIFICANTLY faster connection for a fraction of the cost.  

Unless you intend to increase your own speeds by 100 times, while dropping your price by 88% then you are not likely to ever get me back.

Now to post this on facebook, where I am friends with many of my neighbors.  I wonder how many of them are unaware how much faster and cheaper the local fiber optic company is?",0

"Xfinity Internet UnstableFor the past four months, my home internet has become unstable.  The upstream will drop occasionally, for about 5-30 seconds at random throughout the day (on average, about 15-50 times spread out), and it's incredibly frustrating when you are gaming or trying to use a smart device and the net just drops for a moment.

At first, I figured the modem/router may be the culprit, so I looked into the new gigabit service and figured I might as well go all out and upgrade.  I purchased the NetGear CM1000 (Comcast approved gigabit modem) and a gigabit Edge-Router (ER-X).

Since then, we've had a total of 9 technicians come out to the house, redo the lines, connections and adjust the signal.  When the net works, it's great (speed test around 900 Mbps), and haven't had any real issues outside of the unstable drops.  I have a log setup on the router that pings google's DNS and reports when the net goes down, and it's like a christmas tree to say the least.

I keep calling out techs and speaking with the live chat reps to schedule appointments and ask for my account to be credited for the days, but this is becoming such a hassle.  Each tech that comes out, I explain the situation in great detail, they check the signal and the lines then claim the node is fine, and the problem must lie either on my computer, or my network setup (which is untrue, as the setup is completely new, and just a simple wired connection).  What more can I do but continuing to call our service technicians like I'm cursed to have bad internet forever?

I'm just one person, the internet is a holdover from when I lived with roommates. I dont need such a high speed or $95/month for it.

"End of my 1 year contract.My current 1 year new customer promotion is set to expire on Monday, 7/23. My current plan is the HSD Performance 55 for $29.99 in California.

I wasn't interested at the time, they were also able to verbally offer me a one year extension of my current promo, but told me to call back later since it would induce a early termination fee.

So here I am, since my contract is ending, I call in to ask for the previously offered 1 year extention/ 35$ for same internet + online TV, but the rep told me he wasn't able to do so.

"253 dollar Comcast Bill. I'm new to ""adulting"" so I'm way confused on why it's so muchIf someone could help me out here I'd appreciate it.

My SO got internet out at his/our place about a year ago. It's his little brothers account but he's basically ""loaned"" it to us for the time being so I'm pretty on top of paying it...my SO and I agreed that I would be the one to pay the $81 bill a month, okay, nbd. I remember paying it May 25th, 2018 for sure...and I remember having a conversation with my SO on June 22nd to pay it, I swear I paid it but my bank statement says otherwise. My SO's little brother messaged him today and asked him why I haven't been paying the bill because we owe a lot of money...$253 to be exact...but I need to pay the $81 to avoid service disruptions...but if I paid it on the 25th of May, wouldn't that mean my next bill is due on the 25th of June? So correct me if I'm wrong wouldn't that make me only 23 days late for paying my monthly bill? So how come I'm being charged for TWO months when two months haven't even passed yet?",0

Essentially, I got Extreme 150 internet. Am I suppose to have this ""speed increase"" charge of $20? I was under the impression this WAS the package I got, not $69 PLUS $20. I was NOT expecting this. At all. I knew my bill would roughly be $80 or so, but there are not any stated 'one time fees' or anything so I was just confused.

"Fix phone service yourself!At the end of June when Comcast had that large outage I lost phone service for a few hours. It was restored only to go out a few days later. I haven't had it now for about a week and I've tried all the usual things, restarting the router, sending a new signal, etc. I had a text scheduled to come out but there was no way there was a problem with my modem or the lines coming into the house. So I decided to do a little digging around on their website. I found out that the modem that was on my account was one that I had previously rented 3 years ago from them but had returned and was now using my current one. The same issue was happening with my cable box where the listed device was an old serial from 3 or 4 years ago. To fix I called up Comcast and had them re-add the modem that I have, that has been on my account now for 3 years and been working fine, and to remove the old one. May not be a fix for everyone but it doesn't hurt to check what Comcast has listed on their website under my devices and see if it matches the serial number for the device that you're trying to fix.",0

"Seattle nodes / routing ruining gaming connection for anyone else?I'm located in Portland, Oregon and always get routed up to Seattle when connecting to a game server in Sacramento (FFXIV).  Despite being routed in the complete opposite direction of where I want to go, my ping almost without fail always increases by upwards of 5x what you'd expect when I hit the Seattle nodes.  Some days I'll make it through unscathed, but more often than not my 30ms ping will hit the 200ms range, sometimes even upwards of 500ms.  This isn't one specific problem node either but a very consistent occurrence on several Seattle nodes.  After my connection gets butchered up north I am finally routed back down to California with awful ping, ending usually in the 150ms range or so with constant packet loss.  

Is this normal?  I would expect connecting from Portland to Sacramento wouldn't be giving me such terrible ping / routing.  I've called multiple times but trying to explain my issues to them seems to just fall on deaf ears, or rather ears that don't understand what a tracert is.

"Comcast fucked us over when we moved and we now owe them almost $300 for literally nothing and the refuse to refund us.So we moved in May. We called Comcast, they switched our service to our new house, and even told us our speed was upgraded for free because service in our new area was faster! Wow that sounds awesome okay. We were paying $60 at the time but now we would be getting speeds that would have cost us $90!

And here is where the royal fuck up begins. 

When they switched our service over they created an entire new account without telling us. This means we had a new login and a new account to pay bills on, but they told us we would still be paying on the same account, so we did! They then charged our new account that we have no access to $100 for the first month of service?? Which should have been $60 anyway but the lady who upgraded us for free apparently forgot the free part. When we didn’t pay it (BECAUSE WE DIDNT KNOW THE BILL EXISTED) they started charging us late fees and ultimately turned off our internet without warning. My fiancé works from home some days, this this completely screwed him over. Not to mention we thought we had been paying for our service. And we had! At our previous house! We paid for two months of service at a house we didn’t live in and owed almost $200 on an account we didn’t know existed! After being on the phone with Comcast for maybe a total of six hours, half of that time was either on hold or the call dropped so we had to call them back again, we ultimately gave up and went straight into a Comcast store to yell at them in person because even when calling during their billing departments business hours, we were still told it was closed. 

So we go in in person, get told we MIGHT get a refund, and after waiting two more days, the refund got denied! So we are trying again. :)

I hate Comcast so much. Every other internet provider in the area only offers 20mbps, Comcast offers 300. They are pretty much our only option and they are trying to fuck us over on ridiculous charges, turning off our internet every couple days, and refusing refunds on shit that is 100% THEIR FAULT.

"Comcast Data Usage is definitely wrongI saw a few other posts on here regarding data usage but didn't see a resolution, so I figured i'd share my story.

I signed up for comcast about 2 weeks ago and they are saying im over my data limit. I have the 150 down package (and actually get 160, high five)

It's the 12th day of the month and i've ""used"" 1233 gb of data according to comcast. That's right, a family of 2 with no kids and minimal downloading has used 100 gb of data per day.

Laughably high, right?

We watch netflix most days and have YouTube TV, but all in, we probably watch 2 hours of TV per day. By everything im seeing on the internet, that's about 7gb per hour at the very max (4k), so let's assume 20gb for TV. That still leaves 80gb unaccounted for.

Here's the thing. I have Google WiFi and it tracks EVERYTHING. According to Google, i've only used 350 gb of data (30/day), which I totally believe.

So essentially comcast is saying im using the data and i have proof that im not. Any ideas? I can see every device connected to my wifi so as far as im aware, there isn't anyone leaching my wifi. That and I live in the suburbs, so unlikely anyway.",0
"Maybe it is just me, but Instant TV sucksI have my own modem/router and subscribe to $49.95  HSD Perfomance starter (15Mbps).

I tried the Xfinity Instant TV ($18), and it was just awful.

The thing that turned me off the most was the same channels over and over in the guide. I add say NBC HD, and there is like 6 of them in SD and HD. There was no way to add just the one particular HD channel that I wanted without adding duplicates...you add one, it adds them all. 

For example, I added local News channel, HD versions of NBC, FOX, CBS, ABC, CW, PBS, and some non-HD like Comet, AntennaTV, COZI, Bounce, Heros & Icons, and ION.
 
But instead of having just 13 channels in the guide...I had over a 50 channels in my guide. PITA to surf through.

The other non-HD channels like Comet, Antenna TV, etc., were so bad in quality they were almost unwatchable. Res was way under 480 (SD).

I couldn't even get through two weeks before I canceled Xfinity InstantTV. The 20 hours DVR was bad, but doable with ondemand. But the overall experience was not one which I want to ever repeat.

Don't waste your money. You can get more for your buck (live cable and ondemand network tv for nearly the same price)

In the end,  I just added the following apps to my 3 Roku devices on our 3 HDTVs for live and ondemand tv...much better deal ($22/month total cost).

* Philo ($16) live and ondemand streaming cable TV
* CBS All Access ($6) live CBS and ondemand
* NBC free ondemand
* ABC free ondemand
* FOXNOW free ondemand
* The CW free ondemand
*  COMET free live tv (kinda like a free SYFY channel)
* ROKU CHANNEL (kinda like having free Netflix/Crackle)

When I was cancelling the only Comcast/xfinity item left the customer service rep was like “oh you also have an early termination fee” I said “no I don’t, I signed up for xfinity home almost 5 years ago and if the contract is longer than 2 years that’s against Illinois utility code law”. She told me that when I called to cancel my internet (since their packet quality is terrible, yeah speed test says real good but the actually data is garbage) they automatically repackaged me and renewed another agreement/contract for 2 years. She said I’d have to call another person Bc the computer automatically generates a early termination fee. Are they serious? First of all the thought that Comcast/xfinity actually owns a cellular network for cell phones is a joke.

"Considering ditching rental modem/router, need adviceHi! I currently have the Xfinity Performance Internet package (up to 60 mbps) at promo price of $39.99 ($29.99 with self-service discount). I am also paying $11 for equipment rental - the Arris TG1682G. I have no complaints with either the internet or the router/modem other than the $11 per month I've spent for the past year. I'm looking at returning the equipment and getting my own router and modem (separate, since that seems to be the recommendation). 

I live in an apartment, roughly 1200 sq ft, two floors. The modem/router is downstairs in living room, allowing me to have my PS4, Switch, and Wii U to connect via ethernet. WiFi is used for iPhones, laptops, and fire stick. I have no trouble right now with the WiFi connecting upstairs. I've already been here for almost a year and will be here for at least one more (grad school). 

I've found a combo on Amazon for a Netgear CM500 modem and AC1750 router for $110, which seems like a good deal to me considering that's less than one year of renting from Comcast and it seems to have good reviews. Here's the link (it's the fourth option down):

1) Is this a good choice? I was also considering the Arris SB6183 + a fairly cheap router (never settled on one). I'm open to other recommendations, but I'd like to stay under $150.

2) What is going to happen when my ""promotional period"" ends? How much will my bill increase, and is there anything I can do about it?

Thanks!",0
"I've never had or signed up for DVR service before. I got a popup on my X1 box saying it has been updated, and now I have DVR. Should I expect an increase in my bill?I haven't noticed anything on my account, but I suddenly have DVR enabled with my X1 box. Is this a mistake or are all accounts enabling DVR?",0
"Business internet - how can I get Comcast to fix an intermittent problem that doesn't occur when the tech is here?The Issue I'm having is that, about twice a day, I loose the internet connection for all wired and wireless devices on site. Unplugging / re-plugging the modem power cord fixes it. The problem doesn't happen when the tech is on site.

Also, the tech says that his diagnostic app tells him that the modem has never been power-cycled or lost a signal, even though, as I said above, I have done that once or twice per day.

At this point he gave me the vibe that he doesn't believe what I'm telling him, and leaves without repairing or replacing the modem.

I'm convinced that it's an issue with the modem itself, but how can I convince Comcast? ",0
Xfinity Mobile for AndroidDo you guys have a rough idea of when Xfinity Mobile will be available for people that have their own unlocked Android phones? Thanks. ,0
"Trying to self-install an Xfinity modem, online light wont turn on.Part of my HoA fees for the neighborhood I just moved in to include xfinity internet and TV. I went to a local store and got a free modem, 4k TV box, one regular HDTV box and one with just HD basic cable.

I'm trying to install the modem to set up wifi. I did everything in the instructions, and after waiting X amount of time the ""online"" light on the front wont turn on. 

Its plugged in to a power outlet and whatever the port that the coax cable connects to is called. I've tried multiple ports in the house, called their CS line and did what they asked, and they verified that the service is activated for my address. They want to send out a tech for $60. Anything else I can try?",0
"So I'm gonna replace my modem to save money. Can anyone recommend an affordable and better one?Probably gonna spend $50-60 on a modem and I just have a couple of questions. My plan is the100gb package. I want a modem that's gonna last a long time, at least a few years. I've heard after 3 years, their performance begins to degrade. I'd like one that I won't have any issues with handling gaming and there's about 3 or 4 wireless devices we use in the house, phones, tablet. It's a mobile home so it has a long hallway and the modem we have now is strategically placed at the end of the hallway so it reaches to the back bedroom and the living room and kitchen too. So dual band WiFi has helped alot. But i want to know what you guys have had success with. Or if there's something better.

I haven't bought a modem in probly 10-12 years so if there's any other things I should know, feel free to give any pointers, it'd be greatly appreciated. Also if it's worth it to spend a little more, why and for what reason? I know it'll pay for itself so I'm open to that. What have your experiences been like? Any lessons you learned or things I should avoid when choosing? Any models you know of that have features that are essential or I'll be glad I invested in? Whatever you got. I'll take any info you guys can offer. I only know the basics. Thanks everyone. Oh, the Comcast modem I have is an Arris TG 1682G if that helps for comparison purposes.

Edit: tried to set flair to ""advice"" but it keeps resetting it to support for some reason.",0

"Unable to Log Into My Account / Xfinity StreamI had a weird issue where my internet was working fine but I was unable to log into any Xfinity services (My Account, Xfinity Stream, Bill Pay, Email, etc.). I was able to connect to these services using my phone (Celluar Data).

After wasting an hour w/ Tech Support, I found another thread on here where people had the same issue. The solution was to power-cycle the modem.

Very strange, but hope this helps anyone else who's been having similar issues lately.",0
"What is the best deal for Internet-only service in the US that I can negotiate with Comcast?I  called, and they offered ""Performance Plus"": 60Mbps for $44.95 with 12  or 24 months contract, I couldn't understand the difference between  them. I feel this is too high.

What is the best deal you are getting?

I definitely don't need any TV service or anything else.",0
"When to cancel business internet?I signed up for business internet a year and a half ago and have a 24 month contract. I moved out of an area Comcast services. I tried talking to them, but (I'm sure to nobody here's surprise) they wouldn't do me any favors. It was either a lump sum payment of my remaining balance they called an ""ETF"" or keep the service and pay month to month until the contract was over. Well, I couldn't stomach shelling out that lump sum, so I'm going month to month until it ends.

My question is, when is the right time to cancel? I assumed I would call on the anniversary of my 2 year and break up with them. I have also read around the internet and on here that they require 60 day notice. Can I give my 60 day notice 2 months before my contract ends? Or do I have to wait until my contract is over and then give them notice, essentially extending the contract an additional 2 months? I don't want to give them any more money than I have to.

I tried looking around for this, but couldn't find any definitive answer. I'm hoping someone here has the insight. Thanks!",0
"Tried to negotiate my bill, they were not interested?Hi,

I have been with comcast for 3 years now. My bill was high since my promo ended so I called and told the automated line I wanted to cancel to get to a person. I'm not good at this negotiation stuff and this was my first time trying the ""I'm going to your competition..."" thing. The guy doesn't even try to work with me, he just says, ""ok sure, when would you like to end service"". I was caught off guard and knee jerk muttered ""um, tomorrow"". The guy types some stuff and says, ""ok it's all set, please return your rented equipment in 10 days..."" I guess he called my bluff but now I don't have TV,internet,or phone starting tomorrow, great.",0

What happens if I don't pay my last non contract billI was out of contract with Comcast and I switched to Verizon. What happens if I just don't pay that last bill with Comcast?,0
"Missing promo gift cardI resigned a contract for Comcast Business Class with promotion code RET-Central:SPDPTP_$79.95D50_GC2 on 3/15/2018 and was told I would receive a prepaid card 6 to 9 weeks after the first 30 days of service. 

9 weeks would have been 6/16. I still have no gift card. Any Idea which department or contact number I should use?",0
"Cancel on the day?I have been a comcast customer for about a year. recently, my bill went up. I tried calling to see if they could keep it the same price as before, the price will match its competitors price. They could not do that for me. I decided to cancel my service on 7/25 (that is when the cycle ends) I was told that they could not schedule a cancellation and that if I wanted to cancel it on that day I would need to call on that day and have it cancelled. Is that true? ",0
"Comcast starts throttling mobile video, will charge extra for HD streams",0
is the dcm475 still relevent?Apparently it's discontinued but it is the only modem that my service sells. Plus they're all used. Does that mean that it is a thing of the past and I should look for a different one?,0
"Comcast Business lied about service change. Options to get out 6 months early?I signed up for Comcast Business in August 2016. I made a change 6 months later with assurances from the retention clown that it would not impact the length of the 24 month contract. They had me sign an agreement where I asked about the 24 months term. I was told my two years would be up in August 2018. 

I called today to give a 60 day notice to cancel the service only to be lectured by the retention clown that Comcast has the best lawyers and that adults sign agreements that are not always best for them. When I told the person to relax with the condescending attitude and just help me understand what happened, she became offended and hung up on me. 

Anyway, I called back. The new lady flagged the call for review. Let’s see if anything happens. 

Let me get back to my question: I was told that the 60 day cancellation notice applies as does an ETF if I leave before February 2019. The retention clown stated I could open a residential account but they would check on it near the end of the original business contract term to make sure I didn’t cancel it early. This sounded odd as they never checked in the past. 

What’s the strategy to get out now?",0
"Comcast Business Internet with Static IP Requires a modem rentalI'm not posting for any reason other than to alert others to this issue (maybe its well known?).  I recently attempted to purchase my own modem, an Arris Surfboard 6183 cable modem, to replace my Comcast rental.  Comcast is charging me $15/month for a rental modem which seems excessive considering I also pay $20/month additional for the static IP address as well.

I found that they listed the Arris as a supported modem and proceeded to order it.  Upon receiving it, I hooked it up and called Comcast to get it set up.  At first, it appeared not to be working at all.  I hooked up a laptop directly and I could get a dynamic address.  However, my static IP wouldn't work.  Level 1 support claimed that my setup shouldn't be a problem.  However, after an hour of troubleshooting, they declared that static addresses were not supported with a ""customer supplied modem.""

They transferred me to Level 2 support who stated immediately that they don't support you buying your own equipment with static addresses.  That's a real bummer considering that the rental charge is already far exceeding the value of the equipment.  Unfortunately, it appears if you want a static address you're forced to pay for equipment rental.  There are no options to buy.  ",0
Does comcast not email a bill every month with paperless Billing?i Noticed my bill is ready to view in my account but never received the email  can see the full bill on my account paperless Billing is still turned on i get the email on the 3rd of every month.,0
"Comcast just told me since I don't use their modem they won't send out a technician to troubleshoot the issues that are obviously with their lines.I called cuz I kept having dropped connections. Kids apps like Netflix and YouTube keep saying connection disconnected so I ran a ping -t to a few different web sites and they all keep dropping at the exact same time. Also my Comcast Xfinity TV box keeps resetting all day saying it drop the connection and needs to reset. so I called Comcast they keep me on the phone of course for an hour will they reboot everything and then tell me since I don't have their modem they won't send anybody out to check the lines. They tell me that I'll have to call modem manufacturer and have them modem manufacturer tested since it's my modem. Got to love government instilled monopolies cuz for me it's either this or cellular service.
