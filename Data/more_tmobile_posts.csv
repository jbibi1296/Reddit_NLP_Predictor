2019-04-04 02:40:49,"T-Mobile Employees/Managers - Any discount advice?
Curious if any current or past employees have any advice on how to cut my phone bill when I head back to the store tomorrow. 

&amp;#x200B;

Went in to T-Mobile today to take advantage of my JUMP upgrade. Tech was nice, offered me 25% (he said it was his employee discount) right out of the gate for accessories. 45 minutes go by, and, due to some kind of error with their system they can't process my upgrade without needlessly charging me extra for my phone. No problem - I'll try another store. 

EDIT: For context, the system wasn’t recognizing I’d paid off 50% of the cost of my phone and was trying to make me pay an additional $180 even though I only have 4 payments left. 

&amp;#x200B;

I walk a couple blocks to the second T-Mobile store. Another 20-30 minutes go by, and these folks are facing the same account issue and can't process my upgrade. They offer me a 15% discount on accessories (no surprise there is some flexibility here in what the store is willing to offer). 

&amp;#x200B;

Considering  I'll have made a minimum of 3 trips to T-Mobile by tomorrow, and wasted a good 2+ hours of time,  I'm wondering what is a reasonable discount I should ask for when it comes time for brass tacks. I know in the past I've been able to knock off set up fees and get accessory discounts here and there. Any advice on what's a realistic range/the most you've seen knocked off?",t3_b99ay8,tmobile

I currently have an iPhone 7 on T-Mobile postpaid for my personal phone. 

I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S7 on AT&amp;T for my work phone through my company.

I’m due for an upgrade on both. Upgrading the T-Mobile phone is on my dime, upgrading the AT&amp;T phone is on my company. 

Goal: I despise carrying 2 phones and want to take advantage of dual SIM to combine both lines into one phone.

My understanding is that to use dual SIM with two different carriers, the phone MUST be unlocked and therefore paid off. I’d prefer to upgrade my AT&amp;T phone to iPhone XR and run my T-Mobile in that as an ESIM. But the phone won’t be unlocked as my company is making payments on it and I see T-Mobile does not officially support postpaid ESIM yet. Second choice is to upgrade my personal iPhone to a T-Mobile iPhone XR which will run me about 20 a month, but sounds like I won’t be able to use the AT&amp;T ESIM as that also won’t be unlocked until it’s paid off.

Is my only option to buy an iPhone XR unlocked outright, put my current T-Mobile SIM card in that, then have my AT&amp;T SIM card transferred to ESIM and put that in? Or am I missing other possible options?

The cell phone administrator at my company does not even know what dual SIM is and I had to explain it to her when I asked about it, so I’m not expecting any help there. She pretty much said “we can’t do that” I’m sure just because of lack of understanding. The ESIM transfer seems pretty easy on AT&amp;T and can be done online, so I’m hoping if I give her step by step instructions on how to order one then that would take care of it. Ultimately I just don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new phone only to find out it was a waste because I can’t get dual SIM working... if I can’t do this I’m just gonna ride this iPhone 7 into the ground since it’s paid off.

2019-04-02 20:25:20,"Deprioritization &amp; Network Latency
My first hand experience with deprioritization shows that network latency may be increased when deprioritized, depending on congestion at any given time. When the tower is more congested, the amount of latency variation can be significant for short periods of time. However, under normal loads, not much variation should be observed:

1) [deprioritized line](https://i.imgur.com/Y8fjkS8.jpg) 
vs [non-depriortized line](https://i.imgur.com/4y9pUEG.jpg)

* MIN ping 3-6ms better
* AVG ping 4-7ms better
* MAX ping 12-22ms better
* MEDIAN ping, 5ms better

Research also appears to show that carriers use QoS for network management based on 3GPP standards:

[LTE QoS Link 1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13638-016-0565-9) 

[LTE QoS Link 2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210310)

Further research indicates all carriers may reduce speed when you're deprioritized &amp;amp; the network is congested and it may also result in increased latency:

[AT&amp;amp;T (explicit)](https://about.att.com/sites/broadband/network)
&amp;gt;During periods of congestion, these customers may experience **reduced data speeds and increased latency** as compared to other customers using the same cell site (“Congestion-based Data Management”)

[Sprint (explicit)](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/open-internet-information.html)
&amp;gt;Customers subject to de-prioritization may experience **reduced throughput and increased latency** compared to other customers on the constrained site and as compared to their normal experience on the Sprint network

[Verizon (implicit)](https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/what-network-latency)
&amp;gt;Any number of factors can contribute to network latency, **including the speed and available bandwidth on the network, or the sheer size of the transmitted data packet**

[T-Mobile (no mention)](https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/policies/internet-service)
&amp;gt;Heavy Data Users will have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.

Another person told me that this video proves that T-Mobile's deprioritization does not increase network latency at all and it only reduces throughput. Please discuss how, if any, network latency is influenced with T-Mobile's QoS and deprioritization (during light and heavy congestion).

2019-04-02 06:22:23,"Ongoing Issue With My Phone's Data Connection
Hi, I'm posting this here today in an attempt to maybe find out if anyone else is having the problem as I am because I've spoken to T-Mobile's team of experts regarding the problem and they are just at a loss for any sort of solution.

For the past 3 months my phone has had little to no internet on the weekdays from 8am to 3pm. I'm on the One Plus plan right now and also pay an additional $10 for more Mobile Hotspot data so I'm essentially missing out on all of these perks 5 days out of the week for 7 hours each day.

The issue occurs specifically at the time frame I've listed above and hasn't changed. I called T-Mobile tech support for at least the 20th time yesterday and they finally pinpointed the issue being that my SIM card attempts to connect to two separate cell towers and the signal essentially bounces back and forth for several hours straight, leaving me with no data service. They've also noted that it occurs during low congestion times so too many users connecting to the towers isn't the problem either.

I just don't know what to do at this point. I've tried everything the support team has suggested and they've sent on 4 separate tickets on this issue and have no solution for the problem; I've tried resetting my APN/Network settings, replacing the SIM card, but still every Monday to Friday from 8am to 3pm my data connection is basically non-existent and I'm left with no internet for nearly half the day. The only thing I can do is make calls and send texts.

What can I do to fix this?

EDIT - Tried Factory Reset to revert to an older software version to see if this was interfering with my data connection all along since it may potentially be my phone that is preventing it from connecting to a tower properly. It's a little after 8am right now and everything seems to be functioning properly so fingers crossed!",t3_b8hedg,tmobile

I'm having the strangest problem, which is serious enough that it has me very concerned. In the last few months, I've noticed that the Samsung stock email app just completely misses downloading random work emails. I have it set up via Exchanges AcriveSync, push retrieval. In the last few months, I've seen this happen on three separate occasions. 

I learned about the first two occasions when I went to my desktop Outlook and saw an email that never showed up on my stock email app. I immediately went back to the app, refreshed it, but still didn't see the email. 

I removed the work email account from the stock email app, and re added it. The app then downloaded the missing email. Same thing happened on the second occasion. 

I opened a ticket with my company's IT provider, but they said it's a problem with my phone and that I should switch to a different app. 

Worried, I downloaded Blue mail and have been running it in parallel with the stock app. Just an hour ago, the same thing happened. The email showed up in Bluemail, but never arrived in the stock email app.

2019-04-02 13:04:17,"Data and Hotspot Question on One Plus Plan (Thinking about switching from Verizon to T-Mobile)
Hi T-Mobile People! 

I'm currently on an old Verizon grandfathered unlimited data plan with a ridiculously low amount of minutes and text allowance for a ridiculously large amount of money. I like the unlimited LTE data, but hate paying over $170 a month. I use about 40-75 GB a month in data.

Thinking about moving to T-Mobile. For those of you on the One Plus plan, do you experience a massive slow down on data for your phone if you use more than 50 GB of data in the billing cycle? For the hotspot, do you find the 3G after the 20 GB of LTE Data is fast enough for your needs?

(I realize that everyone's experience may vary and it depends on tower congestion and other factors. Just curious about the overall data service or if there is anything to be aware of before I switch.)

https://imgur.com/a/Z40JxFE

Earlier today I noticed all phones are available for $0 down and on 36 month installments in the app, including latest Samsung Galaxy phones. Now later in the day, it seems all phones are back to 24 month installments and with higher downpayments. even on the main website where they typically would advertise their 36 month plans for the lower monthly payments, now show 24 months. 

Are they getting rid of the 36 month option? Or will we noe get the option to choose between 24/36? 

If so, will we also get to choose between $0 down and higher monthly cost, or downpayment and lower monthly cost? 
or will those depend on the 24/36 month option?

Doesn't seem T-Mobile is sure of what to do thenselves; lots of changes to their payment structure recently.

My account is considered super well qualified, but the prices being shown now seem like the standard prices. 

The ones I saw earlier with $0 down on everything made a lot more sense, even with 36 months. Which is the only option I had prior to today, and now its back to 24 months but higher downpayments. Note sure if this an error, new change, or just my account.
