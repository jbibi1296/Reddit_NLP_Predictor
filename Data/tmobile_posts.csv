"SIM card - $25 ripoffEvery time I call T-Mobile they tell me how important I am to them. I'm an 8 year post-paid customer, never late with a payment, average bill of $100. TMobile, you  can keep your Mobile Tuesday promos - I could give a rip about your silly Taco Bell coupons. And I don't care about the ""dedicated"" support team assigned to my account. You can keep them both. Just don't take advantage of me when I call you because I need a $0.50 piece of plastic from you.

"Connectivity issues on non-LTE/4GI recently switched to T-mobile from Google Fi.  I was already on the T-mobile network 99% of the time on Fi.  My wife and I brought our own Moto x4 devices and I signed up over the phone.  I activated both phones with T-Mobile SIMs and they seemed to work OK for a couple of hours once we had our numbers ported.  My wife's device is still working well.

&#x200B;

I started having problems where my phone would not work with wifi calling (I got a couple errors) and the phone would show service on 2G/3G networks but would not calls or send SMS messages.  I swapped SIM cards at the local T-Mobile store (no cost) but this did not fix the problems.  I then bought a Galaxy S10e hoping that this would fix it all.  The new S10e was activated in store with another new SIM and functioned fine on LTE and Wifi calling once home, but as soon as I hit a non-LTE area the device displays bars (and a signal app I have shows service) but gives me an error: not registered on network.  It also says that I am unable to send SMS.  I have tried factory resetting the phone, restarting, toggling airplane mode on and off, and resetting network settings with no success.

&#x200B;

I have called tech support 2x and both times they checked some network settings on their end, had my restart the phone, and had me reset network settings.  Both times I was ultimate able to make a call on 2G but the issues came back within minutes.

&#x200B;

I like T-Mobile, but if I cant make calls/send messages that doesn't really matter.  I am hoping SOMEONE out there can point me in the right direction, because tech support isn't of much use and I feel like I might be missing something here.

Ultimately I can trade my Pixel 3XL for an AT&t S10 plus and I want to know if it would work. Once I put my T-Mobile SIM card in, will T-Mobile carrier software download to the S10.

"T-Mobile Employees/Managers - Any discount advice?UPDATE: Chatted with support online today and they applied a $25 credit to my account for my trouble. I’ll take it! 

Curious if any current or past employees have any advice on how to cut my phone bill when I head back to the store tomorrow. 

&#x200B;

Went in to T-Mobile today to take advantage of my JUMP upgrade. Tech was nice, offered me 25% (he said it was his employee discount) right out of the gate for accessories. 45 minutes go by, and, due to some kind of error with their system they can't process my upgrade without needlessly charging me extra for my phone. No problem - I'll try another store. 

EDIT: For context, the system wasn’t recognizing I’d paid off 50% of the cost of my phone and was trying to make me pay an additional $180 even though I only have 4 payments left. 

&#x200B;

I walk a couple blocks to the second T-Mobile store. Another 20-30 minutes go by, and these folks are facing the same account issue and can't process my upgrade. They offer me a 15% discount on accessories (no surprise there is some flexibility here in what the store is willing to offer). 

&#x200B;

Considering  I'll have made a minimum of 3 trips to T-Mobile by tomorrow, and wasted a good 2+ hours of time,  I'm wondering what is a reasonable discount I should ask for when it comes time for brass tacks. I know in the past I've been able to knock off set up fees and get accessory discounts here and there. Any advice on what's a realistic range/the most you've seen knocked off?",tmobile

"Disable Forwarding to Voicemail for Roaming?I have a TMO line on a friend's account. In the past he called customer service to disable voicemail on the line. It would ring indefinitely and never be forwarded anywhere.

Today I checked it and it went to voicemail after ringing for a while. So I try the short code to disable conditional forwarding ""##004#"" and it doesn't work. The T-Mobile DOC says that it ""Cancel call forwarding to voicemail (prevents new voicemail messages)"". So why doesn't it?

Source: https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-4041

The reason I don't want voicemail is that when I am roaming internationally I still want the phone to ring. If conditional forwarding activates one is automatically charged a minute of voice roaming. In some cases roaming is $5.99 a minute so it's a big deal.

**Edit:** This is a real issue: ""If your phone is on when you get an incoming call, even if you don't answer it and it goes to voicemail, the call is charged one minute for the call coming in to the phone.""

"Help for understanding options for dual sim to combine personal and work phone on TMo and ATT lines?I currently have an iPhone 7 on T-Mobile postpaid for my personal phone. 

I currently have a Samsung Galaxy S7 on AT&T for my work phone through my company.

I’m due for an upgrade on both. Upgrading the T-Mobile phone is on my dime, upgrading the AT&T phone is on my company. 

Goal: I despise carrying 2 phones and want to take advantage of dual SIM to combine both lines into one phone.

My understanding is that to use dual SIM with two different carriers, the phone MUST be unlocked and therefore paid off. I’d prefer to upgrade my AT&T phone to iPhone XR and run my T-Mobile in that as an ESIM. But the phone won’t be unlocked as my company is making payments on it and I see T-Mobile does not officially support postpaid ESIM yet. Second choice is to upgrade my personal iPhone to a T-Mobile iPhone XR which will run me about 20 a month, but sounds like I won’t be able to use the AT&T ESIM as that also won’t be unlocked until it’s paid off.

Is my only option to buy an iPhone XR unlocked outright, put my current T-Mobile SIM card in that, then have my AT&T SIM card transferred to ESIM and put that in? Or am I missing other possible options?

The cell phone administrator at my company does not even know what dual SIM is and I had to explain it to her when I asked about it, so I’m not expecting any help there. She pretty much said “we can’t do that” I’m sure just because of lack of understanding. The ESIM transfer seems pretty easy on AT&T and can be done online, so I’m hoping if I give her step by step instructions on how to order one then that would take care of it. Ultimately I just don’t want to spend hundreds of dollars on a new phone only to find out it was a waste because I can’t get dual SIM working... if I can’t do this I’m just gonna ride this iPhone 7 into the ground since it’s paid off.

"Deprioritization & Network LatencyMy first hand experience with deprioritization shows that network latency may be increased when deprioritized, depending on congestion at any given time. When the tower is more congested, the amount of latency variation can be significant for short periods of time. However, under normal loads, not much variation should be observed:

1) [deprioritized line](https://i.imgur.com/Y8fjkS8.jpg) 
vs [non-depriortized line](https://i.imgur.com/4y9pUEG.jpg)

* MIN ping 3-6ms better
* AVG ping 4-7ms better
* MAX ping 12-22ms better
* MEDIAN ping, 5ms better

Research also appears to show that carriers use QoS for network management based on 3GPP standards:

[LTE QoS Link 1](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13638-016-0565-9) 

[LTE QoS Link 2](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0210310)

Further research indicates all carriers may reduce speed when you're deprioritized &amp; the network is congested and it may also result in increased latency:

[AT&amp;T (explicit)](https://about.att.com/sites/broadband/network)
&gt;During periods of congestion, these customers may experience **reduced data speeds and increased latency** as compared to other customers using the same cell site (“Congestion-based Data Management”)

[Sprint (explicit)](https://www.sprint.com/en/legal/open-internet-information.html)
&gt;Customers subject to de-prioritization may experience **reduced throughput and increased latency** compared to other customers on the constrained site and as compared to their normal experience on the Sprint network

[Verizon (implicit)](https://www.verizon.com/about/our-company/5g/what-network-latency)
&gt;Any number of factors can contribute to network latency, **including the speed and available bandwidth on the network, or the sheer size of the transmitted data packet**

[T-Mobile (no mention)](https://www.t-mobile.com/responsibility/consumer-info/policies/internet-service)
&gt;Heavy Data Users will have their data usage prioritized below the data usage (including tethering) of other customers at times and at locations where there are competing customer demands for network resources, which may result in slower data speeds.

Another person told me that this video proves that T-Mobile's deprioritization does not increase network latency at all and it only reduces throughput. Please discuss how, if any, network latency is influenced with T-Mobile's QoS and deprioritization (during light and heavy congestion).

"Ongoing Issue With My Phone's Data ConnectionHi, I'm posting this here today in an attempt to maybe find out if anyone else is having the problem as I am because I've spoken to T-Mobile's team of experts regarding the problem and they are just at a loss for any sort of solution.

For the past 3 months my phone has had little to no internet on the weekdays from 8am to 3pm. I'm on the One Plus plan right now and also pay an additional $10 for more Mobile Hotspot data so I'm essentially missing out on all of these perks 5 days out of the week for 7 hours each day.

The issue occurs specifically at the time frame I've listed above and hasn't changed. I called T-Mobile tech support for at least the 20th time yesterday and they finally pinpointed the issue being that my SIM card attempts to connect to two separate cell towers and the signal essentially bounces back and forth for several hours straight, leaving me with no data service. They've also noted that it occurs during low congestion times so too many users connecting to the towers isn't the problem either.

I just don't know what to do at this point. I've tried everything the support team has suggested and they've sent on 4 separate tickets on this issue and have no solution for the problem; I've tried resetting my APN/Network settings, replacing the SIM card, but still every Monday to Friday from 8am to 3pm my data connection is basically non-existent and I'm left with no internet for nearly half the day. The only thing I can do is make calls and send texts.

What can I do to fix this?

EDIT - Tried Factory Reset to revert to an older software version to see if this was interfering with my data connection all along since it may potentially be my phone that is preventing it from connecting to a tower properly. It's a little after 8am right now and everything seems to be functioning properly so fingers crossed!",tmobile

"Samsung s9 Tmobile issue with stock email program - not receiving random emailsI'm having the strangest problem, which is serious enough that it has me very concerned. In the last few months, I've noticed that the Samsung stock email app just completely misses downloading random work emails. I have it set up via Exchanges AcriveSync, push retrieval. In the last few months, I've seen this happen on three separate occasions. 

I learned about the first two occasions when I went to my desktop Outlook and saw an email that never showed up on my stock email app. I immediately went back to the app, refreshed it, but still didn't see the email. 

I removed the work email account from the stock email app, and re added it. The app then downloaded the missing email. Same thing happened on the second occasion. 

I opened a ticket with my company's IT provider, but they said it's a problem with my phone and that I should switch to a different app. 

Worried, I downloaded Blue mail and have been running it in parallel with the stock app. Just an hour ago, the same thing happened. The email showed up in Bluemail, but never arrived in the stock email app.

Should I just upgrade quickly to the s10, hoping this is not a systemic software problem? I was hoping to wait until the 5G version is released. But this issue may force my hand.",tmobile

"What's going on with T-Mobile's EIP Payment Structurehttps://imgur.com/a/Z40JxFE

Earlier today I noticed all phones are available for $0 down and on 36 month installments in the app, including latest Samsung Galaxy phones. Now later in the day, it seems all phones are back to 24 month installments and with higher downpayments. even on the main website where they typically would advertise their 36 month plans for the lower monthly payments, now show 24 months. 

Are they getting rid of the 36 month option? Or will we noe get the option to choose between 24/36? 

If so, will we also get to choose between $0 down and higher monthly cost, or downpayment and lower monthly cost? 
or will those depend on the 24/36 month option?

Doesn't seem T-Mobile is sure of what to do thenselves; lots of changes to their payment structure recently.

My account is considered super well qualified, but the prices being shown now seem like the standard prices. 

The ones I saw earlier with $0 down on everything made a lot more sense, even with 36 months. Which is the only option I had prior to today, and now its back to 24 months but higher downpayments. Note sure if this an error, new change, or just my account.

Jump on Demand issueI just got a new Galaxy S10 plus through Jump on Demand. Of course I traded in my S9 Plus. On this month's bill I am being charged for both phones. I have gotten two different answers from T-Mobile Representatives. One representative said that the S9 plus charge would fall off of my bill by it's due date. Another representative said that it is normal to be charged for both phones. Her reasoning was that I used the S9 Plus for the majority of the month before trading it. That makes no sense to me. If that's the case why am I being charged a full month for the S10 Plus? I'm pretty sure I had this same exact issue when I traded my Note 8 for the S9 Plus. They had to go in and remove the Note 8 for my account even though I had given the phone back in the store. Has anyone else had issues with this? I've got some time before my bill is due but I like nipping things in the bud. If all else fails I guess I will go back into the store.

"B71 - nice thing to wake up to**TLDR: B2 is oversaturated and unusable and my phone doesn't connect to B71 which is very usable.**

I reported a few weeks ago that B71 towers are popping up around Rochester, NY. Still none close enough to my house for a signal.... until waking up today!


My only question is why is my S9+ phone treating B71 like B12, where if the signal is stronger, it still picks up a weaker B2 or B4 as the main connection? Is it because it's only 5MHz?


Weakest location in my house is my kitchen because the brick chimney blocks the LOS to the tower. I'm getting a cool 2 mbps down / 500 kbps upload. Was hoping B71 would fix this but I'm still on B2. Was even hoping for better since it says I'm connected to B2 LTE-A.

I have an iPhone 6 and it’s in great condition(no scratches or anything) but the home button stopped working. I saw other solutions to bring it into the store, but with Costco I guess it has to be mailed in. Does anyone know if this would pass with assurant or should I not even try it? Also if it is rejected as a trade in, does that invalidate the whole terms of the promo?

"Coverage issues for the last month or so.Myself and the other person on this plan have ASUS phones (ZenFone ar and ZenFone 5z respectively). Our coverage was never 100% perfect, but in the last month-month and a half, we've had almost no coverage in areas that worked just fine in the past. We have to find the one spot in any location to actually make calls from, and it can still take up to 30 seconds to actually connect.
I also can't seem to receive text messages half the time I'm connected to wi-fi. 

This is extremely frustrating, as we both love our phones, and switching to something like a galaxy would actually be a pretty severe downgrade in specs. If T-Mobile has suddenly decided not to play well with ASUS phones.

"Seeking adviceI'm thinking about bringing over 4 lines from Verizon. I will also be bringing my own unlocked phones. I'm currently paying about $190 per month, and if I take advantage of the 3 lines for the price of 2 promotion, I'd save about $65 per month once you factor in the free Netflix. 

I went to Costco today to sign up, but didn't realize that the 3 for the price of 2 promo wasn't available through them. So... Would I be better off paying the $100 for my 4 SIM cards through tmobile.com, or getting the free SIM cards from Costco and paying the extra $20 per month? I also see that they are offering $50 Costco gift cards per line, so that's another $200 to consider. 

I'm also eligible for Amplified through my company, and we have an option to get One Plus on all 4 lines for $160 per month. 

Is there something obvious that I'm missing? I feel like just getting the line through Costco to save money on the SIM cards and $200 in Costco gift cards is a better deal than saving $20 with the ""3 for 2"" deal. I think I can covert the Costco plan over to my company's Amplified deal once everything is all set up, too.

"Switch to T-Mobile from Sprint iPhone Forever plan???My uninsured iPhone XR was recently stolen and I'm thinking through my options. I lease the phone through the  Sprint iPhone Forever plan and would be eligible for a new upgrade in September. I owe roughly $500 on the phone so not sure if I have to buy it outright to make up for it being stolen PLUS buy a new phone or if I can purchase a different XR and return that when my lease is up even though the serial numbers will be different.

Just saw that T-Mobile is offering a free iPhone XR for new lines. Wondering if it would make more sense to pay off my remaining lease, switch to T-Mobile to get the new phone promo and stay on their service.

I'm happy with Sprint's service (in DC) but at my wits end with their customer service. I'd like to keep unlimited everything plan and really like the fact that I get free text/2G data when traveling abroad. Currently pay ~$70 a month, which includes $30 for the phone lease and $40 for the plan.

Anyone know how the ETF reimbursement process would work or have any other insights that would prove helpful? With the merger looming, I'm just trying to think through best options as I'd rather not spend >$1000 on a new phone on top of replacing the other items that I was robbed of. ",tmobile

I notice most T-Mobile openings I’ve applied to are only part time, does this ever change? I’ve been FT the last 4 years, are hours usually scarce? 




I know this isn’t a “must have experience” type of role considering a lot of people seem to get this job straight out of HS or with little experience, but can you make a good amount of money here? I was making $17/hr (I live in LA) at my current job, and have already figured I’m most likely taking a pay cut with most jobs I’ve been leaning towards. I saw its base pay + commission from what I could tell online, so I’m kinda hoping I can at least average out at $15-17 an hour.

(I'm a little OOTL on T-Mobile right now, haven't paid much attention to what happened to Jump or anything in the past year)

So I just realized I only have about $165 left to pay off on my Galaxy S9+.   I thought now might be a good time to pay it off, so I could still sell it for ~$400; then jump to maybe an LG V40 or OnePlus 6T.  (I like the pro camera features of LGs phones, and the clean android of the 6T).

So the question is, could I pay off/purchase my S9+ for $165, then immediately start a new Jump lease on a different phone? Or would my only option be a standard EIP?

"Northern NC Service IssuesThis is a long story that goes back to December 11th 2018 so I'll try to shorten it.. 

Originally we were on Metro in December using 2x LG Stylo 4's. We noticed immediately between 7pm to 10am(on 3 different towers) it would commonly lock on to 4-5 bar band 71 with no service, try to connect to 1 bar of HSPA+ or 2 bar Band 12 but ends up with no service at all til next morning. I complained to customer support for a month and sent an email to John Legere with no response from T-Force.  I filed a FCC complaint because we couldn't even make a phone call(No one I talked to could even understand what a Band was.)

After speaking with Metro corporate they sent out ""Engineers"" and couldn't even find the towers at first(Metro Corporate doesn't know what a Band is either.) They even had a T-Mobile Engineering Manager from Charlotte call me. In the end they moved the antennas around a couple times and Metro decided they don't know what's wrong and can't fix it. So corporate refunded me and politely told me to go away..

I had researched back and forth to try to help them diagnose the issue and one theory I had was that it might be network prioritization. So on March 5th I switched directly to official T-Mobile service but unfortunately that did not fix it. On Mar 22nd I bought a Moto G7 Power and the issue continues(it confirmed the Stylo 4's were never the issue though.)

Due to a TV station in Hickory T-Mobile only has 5mhz of Band 71 until they move in September then 20mhz will be available. This area is rural low population with only having Verizon coverage for years, so I doubt everyone bought new phones in 2018 and switched to T-Mobile to congest that 5mhz. T-Mobile had only just littered the rural Stokes county area with Band 71 in December 2017.

It's like a giant puzzle I can't figure out because I have no access to the back end to diagnose it myself. The ""Engineers"" around here appear to be the same as a Cable Service Tech. I need an actual Engineer that can see what's going on and not fiddle with the Antennas; it's not a signal issue.

I only have two theories left:
1. They were being cheap and Band 71 towers here are aimed at older congested base stations in the Mayodan/Madison NC area or King, NC.
2. They setup a base station beside of Verizon's up here and it has shared backhaul bandwith, so people on Verizon are actually causing the congestion(because on Verizon it's painfully slow after 7pm.)

The tricky part was that my wife returned the iPhone 8 to get the iPhone 8+ because it had more camera features. They did not re-apply the $15 reduction each month when she did that.

We just recently paid off the phone in full and called them about the $300 and they said they would credit us the $300 in about a month but they haven't. It's been two months since they said that.

"Question for RF engineersHi,

I am curious why does T-Mobile still utilize band 2 when they can just use band 25 and also have devices be compatible with Sprint/other roaming partners?  Why limit the device to only B2 in the 1900 range?

Also, for AT&T why do they use band 17, when band 12 covers all of the frequencies of band 17?  

Why doesn't the FCC just remove the legacy bands (2, 4, 17, etc) and reclassify the supersets as the ones carriers can use going forward?  It's going to become quite complicated to manage all of these bands.  It's silly to say devices support bands 2 and 25 when technically band 25 supports everything band 2 does and more.

"My last 2 weeks with T-MobileI don’t know if this kind of post is allowed, because it is purely a complaint, but the experience I’ve had over the last 2 weeks with this company is something that I think needs to be shared.

Let me preface with this; all we wanted was to port a line from boost mobile.  Simple enough.  Walked into a T-Mobile store... fairly straight forward.  

To not make this a long narrative story, (but it’s still long) here’s the list of events that followed,

Ported line became my Apple Watch line.  
Apple watches were disconnected from our phones.  
Representative disappears for over an hour.  
Number removed from Apple Watch.  
We’re told everything is back to normal, wait 24 hrs.  
New number won’t receive calls.  
Return to mobile store and spend another 2 hrs attempting to port the number.  
Told it’s fixed, wait 24 hrs.  
New number won’t receive calls.  
Return to mobile store, cancel and restart all affected numbers.  
4 more hrs, finally get a call to come through on the ported number and leave... satisfied.  
Next morning primary phone doesn’t have data and I call to fix have it “turned on”.  
Login to my T-Mobile to check the status of our account to find the primary account holder had been switched to the ported line.  
Call to have that fixed... find I can’t login to my T-Mobile because my email is now associated with another line? Given a ticket number and told I’ll be called back.  
Return from trip abroad while this is happening and call to discontinue T-Mobile one plus and am told I do not have it enabled on my line.  
Ask for the service to be refunded  because I didn’t receive the service.  
An Apple Watch won’t connect to lte.  
Call to have that fixed; along with my email issue which has not been resolved.  
New EID is pushed and... back end email footprint is wiped?  
Same issue with Apple Watch the next day.   Same resolution.  
Can finally login with my email and I check the account status.  See I have T-Mobile one plus?  Call to cancel again.  
Another issue with a different Apple Watch on our plan today. Can’t connect, line reinstated...  
Apple Watch has two digit numbers? Get the extra removed...  
Mobile app/web app still don’t work right ever since the port.  Logging in reveals a bunch of user loading errors.  Customer service reps seem baffled by it.  

I feel like I’m loosing my mind.  I know there’s something deeply wrong with my account and I don’t know what to do.  Every day is at least an hour typing or on the phone with customer service for something new.

"Why Do This?Back in December T-Mobile upgraded the former iWireless site in Centerville, IA to LTE doing a complete rip and replace of almost the entire top of the tower. If anything inside the cabinet got replaced I don’t know. Can’t see through walls. So it was my surprise to drive through town the other day to notice some guys are at the base of the tower assembling equipment and to return a few days later to discover that there was another rack with antennas directly below the top one. I’d assumed it was Band 4. But my reaching out to T-Mobile through Twitter and Facebook turned no results. As they both said the tower wasn’t undergoing any upgrades. Yet there is clearly new antennas on this tower. I’ve uploaded the best photo I got of it to Imgur and will attach as a comment to this post to avoid it populating and appearing like a “who’s on this tower” post that’s led to a mega thread on Friday’s. So I’m wondering if it is band 4 why didn’t they do it during the initial upgrade and why place it on it’s on rack. I did checks to see if I could connect to a band 4 and couldn’t my devices either connected to band 2 or switched to US Cellular for bands 5 and 12.",tmobile
"Pixel 3 cell reception and quality?I was out traveling with family and I've noticed iPhones (7&8's, both ""TMobile"" versions, Intel modems ) would get some reception and data while I'd get nada with my Pixel 3. It'll usually be some inconspicuous place and what not that already has spotty reception with T-Mobile. Occasionally I'll switch over to Sprint and see if there's any signal and sometimes it would be stronger than TMobile, but most of the time it would be in a dead zone too. 

Anyone notice reception quality not on par with other phones?


Edit: was just in antelope valley this past weekend. I had 0 signal and neither did my friends Pixel 2XL. My boyfriend's 8+ was still hanging onto LTE/4g for a bit longer before he finally lost signal",tmobile

"Does anyone else feel like iPhone users are screwed on T-mobile?My wife and kids all use iPhones - an iPhone 8 (wife), SE (son) and 5s (daughter).  I am looking to buy my daughter and son a better iPhone.  The whole add a line, get $750 got me thinking - 1 that I wish I could have taken advantage of it (my wife's phone is only half paid off and too valuable to trade in, and of course the SE and 5s weren't eligible) - I wish I had had an iPhone 6/6s - and 2 I didn't really want a new line (or have to play games with Costco deal).  The kids don't always get receptions where they need it and I don't want to buy them new iPhone XR. 

There are really no used phones out there that have all the bands: the 8 - which is more than I am looking to spend on a kids phone - doesn't have band 71.  The 6s, SE and 7 are missing 66 & 71, the 6 is missing 12, 66 & 71 - so that is out for sure).  (You can get the SE new on clearance right now for a decent price - $300 with 128gb - and $50 less for 32gb).  

I keep looking at Verizon (they have some really good deals to move over) - but I have a pretty good plan ($120 SCNA 10GB - upgraded to unlimited data) - and I don't want to give it up to play the switching game - as I'll never be able to get back to that plan.   I may try calling T-mobile, but at what I am paying, I suspect I am not a good enough customer to try to keep or give me any breaks!  I've started saving some each month (what I would save by not switching to Verizon!) to upgrade the phones to at least iPhone 8's - but that will take a while.

A few questions 

* what do/would y'all do? 
* I don't think Android is an option, but would be curious if you've switched - how did it go?  iMessage is the killer for my kids and they also have iPads - I keep writing Tim Cook - I'd even pay a subscription for iMessage.  But maybe I need to get more serious about switching from Apple.
* how important are bands 66 & 71?  (In the Houston area?)
* looking at something like h2o wireless (AT&T MVNO) as a pretty cheap (like $3 per month) stop gap - and pick up a cheap SE.  Anyone know how the SE (it appears to have all the ATT band - but not totally sure) work on ATT?  But hate doing this considering I have T-mobile lines for them - and eventually the data will be really important to them, but they can live with texting while out and wifi/iMessage from home for now",tmobile

Our iphone’s have about a year of payments left. Can we combine carrier freedom & the 2 for 100/110? It seems like the best deal so far.

It does have 2 LAN ports onboard. I have not tried them.

the phone app only lets you set passcodes, but does let you see the LTE strength so you can determine the ideal placement.

If anything, it would be a good way to retain their customer base from churn, and give low to middle-income families and individuals an opportunity to get better things for the home without having to front the entire amount or put it on their credit cards, including but not limited to TVs, game consoles, laptops, etc.

They’ve already started with smart home products, so this seems like a next logical step in that direction.

"T-Mobile Screwed me over big timeI walked into a T-Mobile store to ask about the Carrier Freedom promotion. As I wanted to get the S10+ and have T-Mobile pay off my current Pixel 3XL device that I got through Google Fi. I was assured twice once in store and over the phone at the time of purchasing the phone that Google Fi qualifies for the promo, Got my S10+ new plan through T-Mobile and all is well for a few days. I go to the link to check out the steps in the process to get the phone back to them and the turn around time for me to get the card to pay off the 3XL, I enter my number and the system say that I am eligible for the carrier freedom. I click the get started button on the page and I keep getting and error ""Stating that I didn't get my phone back to them in time so I don't qualify for the promotion.

So I call customer service and speak to a rep who informs me that phones coming from Google Fi don't qualify for the promotion, I explained to her that I was reassured ""twice"" that I qualify, she said that because Google Fi uses T-Mobile towers and users under the Google Fi umbrella don't qualify for the Promo. I said ok so why was I told twice that I qualify? I already canceled service with Google ported my number over and purchased a new phone what am I supposed to do. She tells me that I can send the phone back and get my money back, I explained that is not an option as I owe google $624.00 for the phone and I won't get service until I pay that balance off. She puts me on hold and tells me that she spoke to a supervisor and nothing can be done sorry.

I spoke to another rep that told me the same thing. I spoke to Google Fi rep and she was upset with the issue, She had me do a 3way call with T-Mobile asked to speak with a supervisor and explained Google Fi is a service provider and said that because I was assured that I would get the Promo they have to honor it. After trying to dodge for a few mins the supervisor said that she will note my account I can take my final Google  bill and phone to a store so they can see the physical bill and they will call and it can be processed.

This was yesterday. I called today to verify that the notes are on my account then the rep ask to put me on hold. I explained to her that I already went through this with 2 reps and a supervisor yesterday. She said she understood and put me on hold, yep came back with the same explanation I said you guys messed up ok fine mistakes happen. But you guys should honor this cause I made the switch because you T-Mobile told me that I am qualified. She then tells me there is no way to override the system from her end. I said cool can you transfer me to the Carrier freedom side so I can speak to someone. Put me on hold and came back with the same story telling me that there is no way to fix this and they are sorry. I ask then why is Google Fi an option when searching the list of qualified carriers no one can answer me that question, I will potentially be out $624.00 if they don't honor this promotion. They keep saying sorry our mistake we gave you bad info twice but no one is trying to fix it. I had T-Mobile for many years I would leave and come back they always had the best plans and Customer service was great. If I am forced to stay with them is this what I have to expect going forward?

I know I am just one customer in a company that has millions of users around the world. But when did we start treating our customers like this, I am not sure what other options I have and would like some suggestions. This is just wrong on all levels and I just can't sit back and accept that this is the norm.

"How to contact someone above a store manger?I’m not sure if this is the right place, but maybe someone here can help?
Basically i have been trying to contact the store manger for over 2 weeks over a billing issue (unauthorized charges) and every single time I call he is “in a meeting” and can’t come to the phone. At this point I have called 6+ times over 2 weeks, and he won’t talk to me. I have talked to an employee who was talking to him but they would not put me on the phone with him. I really don’t understand why, since I have sincerely made an effort to be polite and not get impatient. Anyways. Does anyone know how I can contact a district manager, or somebody above a store manager? I just need to talk to someone who can help me resolve this issue since the general employees can’t, and the manager won’t.

"Tmobile lied to us...So when I switched over to Tmobile I was told by the saleswoman that the Galaxy S9 and S9+ both supported 5G. Now, I personally don't give a shit. LTE is perfectly fine for me. And yes I should have done my own research. But I went in set to buy the phone anyway so it really didn't influence me at all.

What i don't like is that when I went over to look at the S9+ and my mom went over to the S9 the saleswoman made a point to let us know that they were 5G compatible and that Tmobile would be rolling out 5G soon. Now I'm over here waiting for some technology I was told I have that it turns out I do not.

"T-Mobile ONE Video Tethering- Faster than 600 kbps?I'm temporarily using the 600 kbps T-Mobile ONE tethering as my primary internet. I'm on a OnePlus 6T (unlocked version, not purchased from T-Mobile). When I surf the web or download a large file, it's consistent with the 600 kbps speed, as are speed tests. However, YouTube streams at 480p and sometimes at 720p with almost no buffering. Meanwhile, a video on a random non-video focused site only gets 240p/360p. based on this behavior and looking at my tethering/non-tethering usage in the app, I think what's happening is my YouTube streaming is not getting tagged as tethering and is streaming at the higher 1.5 mbps rate.

Thank you for clarifying on that for me Ron! I was looking into this and it does look like we should still be able to add MI lines to your account. Were you getting any kind of error when trying to add a new MI line?

Certain locations will still upgrade me to a new phone even with me not being authorized, and the only reason I haven't is because I have been unsure of what I wanted to upgrade to. 

So, should I just go to one of those locations to upgrade and return so I can just be done with it and start over with my own plan? Or should I just wait until December when my lease is up?",tmobile
"Ran out of high speed data, but somehow got more without doing anythingI usually run through my 3Gb of high speed data about two weeks into my month. This month was no different. I wasn't scheduled to start with a fresh 3Gb until the 27th of this month. It's been slowed down since maybe the 10th of this month. ""Binge on"" always helps stretch my data but never enough. 

For some reason though, at the beginning of last week I started getting high speed again. I didn't buy a data pass, nothing else has changed recently other than I got a new phone at the beginning of this month. 

This morning I woke up to the normal horrible speeds I'm used to once I've hit my data cap. 

I'm not complaining, it was nice to be able to stream Netflix and such, it was just odd. I'm guessing it was just a random network glitch.

We have T mobile in NYC. Service is A+

Now a  weird promotion by Verizon Fios (home internet) allows us 6 free Months of Netflix as well. 

The person told me we'd receive an e mail about the promotion. We are to log in to our Netflix account and a credit would be applied for the 6 months.

FCC Spectrum Auction Tops $1 Billion,tmobile
"iPhones- Wifi Calling Not Working at HomeMy household has 3 T-Mobile iPhone lines on our postpaid account. We also have a Prepaid T-Mobile line on an unlocked Sprint iPhone 5S.

Here is the problem. **None of our postpaid iPhones will register on T-Mobile Wifi calling in the house.**  Our prepaid, unlocked, formerly Sprint iPhone 5S works on Wifi calling on the same Wifi network just fine!  We also have a Verizon iPhone 6S that also registers, albeit intermittently.  Our ISP is Comcast/Xfinity. They say they don't do any blocking of T-Mobile or Wifi calling on their side. Our router is an Asus GT-AC5300 tri-band gaming router.

Here's the weird thing. Of all our phones, why is it only the **T-Mo Prepaid, formerly Sprint iPhone 5S** that is reliably working on Wi-fi calling? Of all the iPhones this is the one I'd \*least\* expect to work.

All the iPhones work reliably on Wi-fi calling in two specific places.  One of them is at my parent's house, and they have Charter/Spectrum. Their router is a slightly different model than mine but it is configured identically to my home router. It also works at one of the branch offices of my places of employment, however it doesn't work at our main office location. They have AT&T 100 Mbit fiber as their ISP and they say IPSEC outbound connections are not firewalled.

Of course being iPhones, the devices won't give error messages or tell you what the problem is, the old adage of it ""just works"" sadly doesn't seem to apply anymore.

Here is what I have tried so far.

1. All of the steps at [https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3255](https://support.t-mobile.com/docs/DOC-3255)  Including the E911 settings as well.
2. All phones are running latest IOS 12.1.4 and carrier settings bundle 35.0.1
3. The Airplane Mode workaround. **If I enable Airplane Mode and then enable Wi-fi, ALL of the phones are able to register on Wifi calling and are able to make and receive calls through our Wi-fi network.**
4. Speed test.  We get 150 Mbps downstream / 10 Mbps upstream with all devices.
5. Checked router's NAT Passthrough settings.  IPSEC and SIP passthrough are Enabled. Checked all DNS server settings and they are set to [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) and 8.8.4.4.
6. Factory reset the router even though I think all the settings are correct.
7. Replaced router with another factory fresh router. No effect.
8. Power cycled cable modem, yada yada yada.
9. Reset network settings on all iPhones.
10. Factory reset one iPhone, still not registering.
11. I have had 3 trouble tickets opened in as many months and the only thing Network Engineering supposedly did was push out some OTA updates to the phones.
12. I chatted with T-Force and they are sending me a new SIM card to see if that helps. **UPDATE:** With the new SIM card installed, WiFi calling worked for like 5 minutes, but it is now back to the ""normal"" ""problematic"" behavior.

The reason I am so concerned about this is because we are getting lots of dropped calls in the house even though we live 3000 feet from the tower and have 4 ""full"" bars of signal strength.

~~I haven't tried reaching out to Apple,~~ as they believe their products are perfect and foolproof and nothing is EVER their fault.

Any other advice? Is there a way to retrieve or view the log files from the iPhones to see what is preventing them from registering Wi-fi calling?

Thanks in advance for any advice.

EDITS: Grammar, Clarification

**UPDATE:** SIM card swap worked for all of 5 minutes, but now I'm back to the drawing board. This evening I reached out to Apple phone support and spoke with a ""Senior Advisor."" He did remote into my phone and we went over every possible setting.  He did give me a differing narrative than that of multiple reps of T-Mobile Team of Experts and T-Force.  He quoted an internal document saying something to the tune of iOS changed T-Mobile's Wifi calling behavior at some point in later revisions of iOS 11.3 or 11.4.  So, it looks like Apple IS pointing the finger at T-Mobile as I expected. I am scheduled to get a followup call from the rep next week. It seems if this is true, the people down in the ranks of T-Mobile CS have not been informed of these changes to Wifi calling protocols.",tmobile

Wasted over 2 hours at Costco trying to get deal.Hi everyone, I was excited and bought a used iPhone 6 to trade in for the Costco deal where you get a $750 rebate opening a new line. After a long wait and then purchasing the phone at checkout and walking back to the kiosk and attempting to add the line and sign a bunch of paperwork, I found out that we were not able to add another line to my existing 5 line Select Choice plan.

I have been with T-mobile for over 10 years probably closer to 20 years but we switched around and stuff in the past but it has been 10 straight years on this account. I saw that the Simple Choice plans were similar in price to what I am currently paying $120/month before tax for 5 lines and 3GB data but no idea if I could get on that plan or a similar one ASAP so I can take advantage of this promotion before it expires the end of month.

"36 month credits - are you *stuck* with the phone?I picked up an Xr in October (just after release) with 36 monthly credits for my trade in.

In order for me to get the credits, am I allowed to change my phone before this is over, and continue getting the credits?

Here are a few points of concern:

1. I financed the phone (only because it's required for the 36 months of credits). In order to sell it (and then buy a new phone), I probably need to pay it off. Right? And this will end my credits presumably? That's a sizeable loss....

"Using voice line in tablets?Got an older tablet data line that I’m paying about $10 for 5GB now, probably use no more than 2GB per month.

It costs me roughly the same for one more simple choice voice line which also has enough data and the flexibility of having a voice line if I need it(maybe a few times a year). 

Have anyone tried to use a voice line in tablets such as iPad? Will there be any issues?

(Also, does anyone know how much it cost for a wearable data line for Apple Watch now?)",tmobile

"Add data plan to Free Data For LifeI have 2 Free Data For Life plans attached to a Simple Choice plan with 4 voice lines.  For mine, I added a 5 gb plan on years ago fo $10 per month (it shows 2 items: Data Pass-Free Data for Life and Plan: SCNA 5gb at $20 but I think there is some sort of $10 credit with a voice line so I only pay $10).  This one works fine and I have luckily been able to move the sim to my iPad Pro. 

For my wife’, it shows Data Pass: Free Data for Life and Plan: MI on Demand Only at $10 (but I don’t pay anything).  My wife wants an new iPad mini with a plan if it is cheap enough.  A few questions:
Does anyone know if moving the sim will keep the FDFL on the new iPad?  Seems like it should given it worked on my other line.

I see I can click change plan and see both an On Demand (current) and SCNA 2gb and both show $10 for the price.  Can I change to the SCNA 2gb@ $10 and still get the $10 credit so effectively getting 2 gb for free?  If not, will it just charge me the $10?  If I change, would I ever be able to get back to just FDFL.  I ultimately don’t really care about preserving FDFL as tethering is easy from her iPhone to an iPad and 200 mb doesn’t do much, but I do want to preserve the $10 credit and if I could get a cheap (or better yet free) 2gb per month, she would like it (although I don’t think 2gb per month is worth $10).  The bee’s knees would be if I could somehow give her the same 5gb for $10 per month that I have (that does not show as an option, just a SCNA 6 gb for $25, which I assume would be $15 after credit)

Anyway, just looking thoughts, experiences or suggestions before I call customer care or maybe I will just try switching to the 2gb and see what happens.",tmobile

"Alcatel Linkzone Wireless Hotspot and Terrible Customer Service/Technical SupportI just got out of the army and am currently staying with a relative while I wait on the government to complete paperwork that will allow me to start my new job. My relative doesn't have wifi and Verizon (my primary cellular provider) has terrible service in the area. I went to AT&T and T-Mobile to compare prices on prepaid internet plans. The one thing I can attest to for T-Mobile is that their prices blew AT&Ts out of the water, however I very much regret going with T-Mobile at this point. Let me explain why in this post where I'll be providing constructive criticism based on my experience with T-Mobile so far.  


I purchased the Alcatel Linkzone wireless hotspot device with the $85 (22GB) monthly plan. For the entire first month I had no issue with the device or the internet speeds. I used all of the 22GB of data and bought a 7GB data pass for $50. Still everything is working great. When the next month rolled around and I was able to renew the 22GB monthly plan I did. This is where I started having issues. My internet speed drastically decreased. I started off by trying to do some troubleshooting by myself (restarting the device, checking device settings, and performing a factory reset). When none of this worked I decided to give T-Mobile Customer Service a call.

&#x200B;

Upon calling customer service I was transferred to technical support (I was transferred to the wrong place twice before they got it right but that wasn't too big a deal). Tech support told me that I was experiencing slow speeds due to a known issue in which purchasing and using all of the data on a data pass and then renewing a monthly plan would cause slow speeds because the system still thinks you are using the data pass and not the monthly plan. 

Here is my first piece of constructive criticism: Why would you not warn customers purchasing a data pass or monthly plan that there is a known issue that would cause the internet speeds to be slow? I'm spending my hard earned money to not only enjoy internet but also to deal with professional matters that needed to get done before I started my job (and due to this, starting my job was greatly delayed).

&#x200B;

I was told by the technical support that they aren't able to fix the issue and would have to submit a ticket in order for the data pass to be removed. I'm not even going to get started on how outdated the T-Mobile website is (and I've heard from T-Mobile employees that the systems they have to work with are even worse), but why would you not allow your technical support department to make simple changes to user accounts like this? Anyways, I was told it would be 24h - 72h before the issue would be resolved. I told them that I really needed the internet that day and asked if there was anything that could be done. I was transferred again (I'm not sure what department I was transferred to) and spoke to an employee that told me he could fix the issue. After sitting on the phone with him for about 15 minutes he said he had removed the data pass and the internet should be getting high speeds within the next 2 hours. He told me he would continue to monitor the account and call me back in an hour. After an hour I was still experience slow speeds and I didn't receive the promised call. I waited another hour and still nothing. At this point it was late so I went to sleep. In the morning I checked my account and saw that the data pass was still there and the internet was still extremely slow.

&#x200B;

I called customer service again and asked for tech support. I was transferred and then explained what had happened. The employee apologized and told me she would file a ticket (with the same 24h -72h time frame). I told her that I needed the internet today and asked if anything could be done and she explained that she was not able to do anything except submit the ticket at an elevated priority. I was told I would be compensated for my troubles. I purchased a data pass with Verizon for $35 since I was told I would be compensated.

&#x200B;

Now I played the waiting game, using my iPhone as a wireless hotspot until the issue was fixed. One day passes, still slow speed. Two days. Three days. A week. I decided it was time to call back and see what the problem was. Upon calling back I was transferred to tech support and explained the issue. I was told by the employee that she was very sorry for my experience and she would try to make it better. She told me she would submit another ticket at the highest priority and it could take as long as a week for the issue to be fixed and that was all she could do. WHAT??!! We're back to square 1.

&#x200B;

This is where things get really frustrating. I had an issue with my Verizon service and called Verizon customer service. The employee was great and really helped me troubleshoot through the issue. She fixed things on her end and the issue was resolved in less than 20 minutes. After experiencing such great customer service from Verizon I called T-Mobile back very frustrated that they couldn't offer customer service even half as good. I asked for technical  support and then asked to speak to a supervisor. I explained my experience and the supervisor sounded shocked. He asked for the device's number so he could look up info on the account. When he had the account pulled up he told me NOT A SINGLE TICKET HAD BEEN SUBMITTED. ??? I had been straight up lied to by multiple T-Mobile employees and hadn't been getting service that I paid for over a week ago. Completely unacceptable. The supervisor said he would submit the ticket himself to make sure that it was done correctly and it would be 24h -72h. I stayed on the line until he said the ticket was completely submitted. 

&#x200B;

Come 3 days later I got a SMS message saying that the data pass was expired. I tested the device and the internet was still extremely slow. I called tech support and was told that it should be working at midnight when the system refreshes. So after all of that instead of T-Mobile actually handling the issue instead I just waited for the month long data pass to expire. I can't even explain how baffled I am that I could receive this kind of service from a company that is so successful. 

&#x200B;

So here is my constructive criticism for T-Mobile

1. If there is a known issue that will affect a customer's service, make sure that they know about this issue BEFORE they purchase the service
2. Update the outdated website and the outdated system the employees use
3. Give the Tech Support Department more power over accounts. How can they fix anything if they don't have access to tools that will let them fix the issue
4. Properly train employees on how to submit tickets for problem like this
5. Ensure that employees know that it's not okay to lie to customers

"Trying to make sense of this iPhone XR On Us promo going on right now. Just switched from Verizon.So today my family and I switched from Verizon to T-Mobile. We didn’t have time to finish everything today so we’re going back on Sunday to trade in a 6s Plus for the iPhone XR On Us promo.

From how the guy explained it today was that we’d have to pay a down payment on the iPhone XR. The entirety of it seemed super confusing to both my dad and me. 

How is it “On Us” if we’re trading in a phone AND paying something like 150 or 200 bucks on a down payment. They advertise it as a free phone but from my understanding it’s not. I could understand the trading of the phone in, but then a down payment also?

"Questions about switching family plan from Verizon to T-Mobile [CA]My family of three is currently thinking about switching to T-Mobile because it's cheaper and supposedly better reception than the last time we had it. 

We have 2 paid off phones, a Samsung Galaxy S8 and S7E, and a Note 8 with $420 left.

1) The plan is to get two of the new S10's for the S8/S7E, but is it possible to use the Verizon Note 8 on the TM network? I'm assuming it is possible because the #Getoutofthered promotion states ""Switch and keep your eligible device. We’ll pay for it."", but I just want to make sure.

2) How does the promotion work? It says TM will provide a virtual card after 2 weeks, so we keep the Verizon plan for up to two weeks while using TM?

2) Would we be able to keep our phone numbers? We've had the same numbers for over a decade so it would be a huge hassle if we could not keep them. 

3) Do all three members have to be present? We all have very different schedules so it would be almost impossible for us three to go together. I (paid off S8) and my mother (paid off S7E) would be able to go in together, but my dad (not-paid off Note 8) would not be able to go in with us. ",tmobile

"Server Error code 3 while trying to unlock OnePlus 6THey,

Let me preface this with an I'm incredibly annoyed right now. I waited 2 1/2+ hours waiting for a support member to answer my message. When they did, they apologized and said they can't help me. Letting me know that I should bring my phone to my nearest T-Mobile store to let them process the unlock.

Anyway, now for the real question.

While attempting to unlock my OnePlus 6T, no matter the circumstance, it will give me spit out error code 3. When I mean any circumstance, I mean; after factory resetting my phone 3 times, trying it on 3 different wireless networks, trying it using cellular multiple times, after clearing app data including cache.

Nothing has worked.

I'm certain that my device is eligible for the unlock, it has been payed of in it's entirety, and has been on the network since last December.

I'm completely clueless on what to do now.

"The Coolpad Snap flip phone experienceGrabbed the phone just for fun. I actually wish it was on KaiOS like the Alcatel is (or better yet Kai OS 2.5 but that's wishful thinking...). I have no idea what this is on but the biggest issue I'm having is that I can't sync to my Google account to grab my contacts. Only two options, import .vcf or import from sim. Blah. (Nokia 3310 3g was able to import via Bluetooth but I can't seem to even do that.)

Otherwise, has WiFi calling, hd voice and hotspot stuff.

Not bad for what it is. Call quality sounds good, haven't been in a noisy area yet to test those conditions out.

\[Edit: Ooo. I got the contacts thing figured out. Bluetooth sharing, duh!\]

\[Edit 2: Trying to dial a number can be confusing. It's very laggy, you can start punching in numbers and not see anything. Then it goes to a screen that makes absolutely no sense. ""Dial Number / no contacts"" before it shifts to the Calling screen.\]

\[Edit 3: **Don't get this phone unless you really want an LTE B71 unit for calls and text only.** The OS is really NOT user friendly and lags way too much. There's a learning curve involved, not intuitive like with the Alcatel Go Flip which uses KaiOS 1.0. A non-tech savvy person who doesn't want to spend much and who doesn't need B71 might be happier with a smartphone like the Nokia 6.1 if you can catch it at the $180 price point on Amazon. (If you DO get it, soften the blow by getting the $25 gift card back through the T-Mobile Advantage program if your work/organization is on the list.)\]

"Anybody losing cell reception indoor? - Using Galaxy S10Hey everyone, so 3 days ago I started to lose cell service at my workplace in Culver City but only inside of the building. I can't make/receive any texts/calls except only when I step outside. 

Before then, I was getting perfect reception. For some reason I got cut off but not with my colleague who has T-mobile as well and they still continue to get reception indoors. They own an iphone but I don't know if that's the case or not.

I've tried restarting the phone and checking the SIM card for damages or anything, yet nothing seems out of the ordinary and the top of the screen says ""searching""...

Is it my phone's problem? I'm using the new S10 I bought since March 8th and it was working perfectly until just 3 days ago. 

I don't mind not getting LTE or anything but I'm concern about losing the cell reception in general as people won't be able reach me if there's any emergency.

I apologize for the long post and thanks for taking the time to read this. Please let me know if there's anybody experiencing the same problem and any advise or suggestion would be greatly appreciated.


TLDR: Phone not receiving reception at workplace indoor only, seeking for solution.

"Considering an eSIM trial run of T-Mobile service in SLC. WCGW?I'm in Salt Lake City, and I've been on Sprint for probably 12 years. I've been pretty happy with the service until fairly recently, when I started noticing some pretty serious gaps in coverage in areas where it should be (and has been) great. I thought maybe my phone was the problem, so I recently upgraded to an iPhone XS, but I'm still getting the same crappy coverage. 

So I'm thinking of signing up for T-Mobile's ""tourist"" plan through the iOS T-Mobile eSIM app ($30 for 1000 minutes and 2GB) to take the service for a test drive while keeping my Sprint plan simultaneously active. 

My question is, would doing this jeopardize my ability to take advantage of any new customer deals I might enjoy when signing up for T-Mobile One? Are there any other unapparent concerns I need to consider before signing up? 

If it matters, I'll be switching over four lines if/when I make the switch.",tmobile

"An idea regarding thwarting neighbor spoofingFor a good few months now I've been trying to think of ways carriers might be able to thwart some of this shit and then I remembered a little thing called ANI II

""What's ANI II?"" 

Basically it's some supplemental data alongside ANI (a quasi-authoritative caller ID passed between switches in the PSTN, primarily for billing purposes) that tells the network what type of phone the calling party is using. More specifically it's a 2 digit integer. 00 represents a POTS line, IIRC, 61, 62, and 63 represent cellular and PCS, there's some other numbers in their for jail phones and payphones. Unfortunately for now, ANI and ANI II data can only be seen if you have a toll free number. I've actually bought an 800 specifically to get that data, it's pretty cool

""That's pretty cool. But how the hell could knowing the type of phone help?""

Well, think about it really. Most people have cell phones moreso than fixed line POTS and VOIP these days, so it's not unreasonable to think most people will be receiving bullshit calls on their cell phones. This means that the spoofers (unless you've ported your number or something) will likely be spoofing a number that's assigned to a cellular exchange. This is where ANI II could come in. When you spoof a call from a VOIP line, which is by far the easiest way to do this shit, the ANI II ends up being 00, a landline. A cellular number, presenting with ANI II that's completely inconsistent with the kind of carrier the number's associated with. If the FCC would permit it, this is an example of a basic heuristic that could possibly curb some of the neighbor spoofing shit",tmobile

"Advanced Messaging and the OnePlus 6TApparently Tmobile rolled out Advanced Messaging to my OnePlus 6T on March 13th.  That's the day that I stopped receiving messages from several people.

Not sure who to blame here, but took several weeks to figure out and there's no guarantee that my incoming messages will not stop again (it's not like someone calls you everytime they send a text).  On the OnePlus 6T, there are no user configurable settings and the user cannot 'disable' or opt out of Advanced Messaging.

I'm using the Google Messages App which is not compatible with Tmobile Advanced Messages.  Tmobile detects that my phone was upgraded and starts sending texts from other Tmobile Advanced Messages users to the stock OnePlus Messagse app.  Since I'm using the Google Messages App, there are no notifications or any indication that I'm missing messages from certain people.  Outgoing messages are sent just fine.

"Sad to see this provider lose its roots T-Mobile was genuinely a premier customer service provider five years ago.  I gave them a chance and moved my family account from Verizon and transitioned all my phones at the time.  We've spent on average at least $300/month since then.

This was not a popular move at the time as my teenagers disparaged me every time they went out of coverage (which was quite frequent at the time).   Still - they had access to (relatively) unlimited data and some other features which softened the blow.

I won't use Reddit to engage in a customer support issue but suffice it to say this is not the T-Mobile I grew to know and respect over the last five years.   I am in the process of negotiating a new contract with a different provider and it pains me to have to do this.   I have some respect for John L and the team, though that's diminishing.  I can only hope for a re-awakening because otherwise, their business is back to a basic commodity provider.   I had hoped for more.

"Galaxy S10+ Slow 4GLTE Data?I got the Galaxy S10 Plus on March 11th and swapped my old sim card from my old S7 Edge into it. Everything seemed fine until I went to a nearby restaurant and began using my 4G LTE data. I could not load websites with images and other slow connection issues, mind that I had full or 4 bars. I did a speed test and noticed I was only pulling 0.50-1 mbps. I asked my brother to borrow his phone, a Galaxy S9, and tested it. He was getting 20 mbps. Went back home and did another test with wifi off to see what I was getting there. Still the same.

&#x200B;

Keep in mind this area was totally fine with my S7 edge speeds before.

&#x200B;

I decided to use the Tmobile app and text support. We did the basic things like resetting the network settings and trying other sim cards. Even activated the new one that came with the phone. Still issues. I went to the other side of the island I live on near the Tmobile store. I noticed I started pulling up to 111mbps there but still in my town, I only get terrible speeds. Called customer support and explained everything and she said she would contact the local maintenance crews out here and see whats up with them or anything. She said she would give me a call back 3 days after but nothing, 6 days now and I called customer care again and got a new tech person and told him everything and gave him the other ticket number. Apparently she closed the ticket and wrote it off as a device issue. The new guy had me open up some diagnostic screen by typing in some numbers on the keypad and checked my phone status etc. told him how in other areas I get the really high speed LTE data but only in my home town area its slow. He told me it couldn't be a device issue if I can get really high data speeds in one area but in another get slow. Told me something like it is unstable on the network and keeps changing frequencies or something..

&#x200B;

I really hope it is not my phone because it's a pain in the butt to have to personalize it and everything again. So many accounts and just took so long. If it is of course I will do it because I can't be having these dreadful speeds but damn.. some luck I have if it turns to be the phone and not the network in my area...

"Victim of sim swap and phone purchaseA couple months ago, I received a text saying my sim was swapped in my phone. I lost all cellular activity right after. I had contacted tmobile about the issue and they were able to change it back immediately after. I got a new sim the next day for a precaution. I didn’t notice anything off or purchased at that time. 

Last month, I started noticing a finance charge on a new iPhone xr. My mother has a line on our account and I assumed it was hers. She initially bought an iPhone xr but returned it for an xs at Apple, and paid cash in full for the xs. Figured tmobile was incorrectly charging us the xr even after we returned it. After a long back and forth with tmobile about us already having returned the phone, they finally figured out that the return was unrelated and it was a fraudulent purchase. Someone in New York purchased an iPhone xr under an upgrade, and has me financing the phone. I’m in California. The purchase was made on the same day my sim was swapped. 

This is ridiculous how someone was able to walk right into a store and buy a phone under my account. Either the employee is in it, or their security measures are non existent. 

Hoping this gets resolved soon, and I need to place a credit freeze in the meantime. I also had two denied credit card applications around the same time sent to my old address at my parents house. ",tmobile

"What isn't compatible with Hookup (20% off VL's)Hi. I'm having billing issues, complicated issues that have been happening for about a year. I'm currently in talks with the executive response team and despite their own admission that my bill should be as I say, they can't fix it. I know from chatting with others that it is *possible* to get deals like Hookup added even if you don't qualify, *if* it's justified. From a technical standpoint, it can be done. I feel I have enough leverage with my unique set of issues that polite and persistent insistence will get me the discount. But I'd like to know if anything on my bill is incompatible. 

I'm on T-Mobile ONE Taxes Included, 4/$150. ($10 off for a free line I had before on ONE TE)

I've heard before that the T-Mobile ONE TI 4/$130 is incompatible with Hookup, though others here denied that. 

I also have:

•This one's on us (free line just 'cuz)

•Valentines BOGO

•Add 2 lines for 50% off each (May-June 2017)

•Kickback

•One+ PROMO (x6 lines)

•Netflix on US

•BETATHANKS free DIGITS (x4 lines)

•Free DIGITS T&T w/ $5 One+

•SyncUP Drive Basic (not a promo, but is grandfathered)

And for device promos:

•LG Superphone BOGO (twice, 4 phones total)

•OnePlus 6T $300 off w/ trade in launch deal

P.S: If they are totally unwilling to budge, and refuse the hookup deal, my backup plan it to ask for more free DIGITS lines. I think that's also possible. Can anyone confirm if this is a feasible back-up plan? I'd try for doubling what I already have. 3 more T&T lines and 2 Paired DIGITS lines. That'd be $50 in savings, similar to what I'd save with Hookup, but with the bonus to T-Mobile that I'd get $50 more for the same price I pay now, not $50 off that price for the same stuff I get now. I'd rather save the money than get more free stuff, but I'd take it over no deal.

Huge thanks to those who actually read through all this! Thank you to anyone with any info! 

EDIT: To clarify, my bill is currently $25 more than it should be due to the half off two lines promotion not working with the lines it's supposed to be on, despite everyone I talk to agreeing that it should be compatible. Additionally, they are trying to switch me from my $5 SyncUP DRIVE plan to the $15 plan for two lines. In total, it would be $45 extra. And yes, the $15 plan is $15 for me, not $10, because autopay maxes out at 8 per account, and the SyncUP DRIVEs are lines 9 and 10.

"Just got a kid's 4G tracking watch, runs on T-MobileI know this post isn't going to interest most of you, but it you have small/pre-teen kids, and are looking for a 4G watch that's also a phone to keep tabs on them, please read further:

I've been saving one of my November, 2016 Simple Choice free lines for my daughter, and she's now at the age where we want to keep tabs, but not hand over a cellphone just yet.

We found a 4G kid's watch that runs on the T-Mobile network: TickTalk 3

It comes with a RedPocket sim, but we just popped in our free line sim, and it's working fine! Has a built-in firewall, so only Mom, Dad and others we place in the contacts can call the watch, and my kid can call back. Won't allow telemarketers, line spoofers, etc. through!

We can text, facetime, see where she is at any second. It's waterproof (although they say you shouldn't swim or anything with it... so more like water RESISTANT, I guess), and is getting great 4G wherever we've gone so far... (have had it since the beginning of the month.) Can also be used worldwide.

Trying real hard to not make this sound like a commercial (nope, not getting paid to post this, and yep, I had to buy the watch myself.)

If you have any questions, I'll do my best to try and answer them. If you want to use the Red Pocket sim/plan instead (runs on the T-Mo network), I think they have a $10/month one that's set up to work with the TickTalk 3... you HAVE to use a plan that's a real phone plan w/voice/data/texts... a wearable plan won't work with the TickTalk 3.

"Experience adding a line, swapping SIM cards, and keeping promosSo, I just managed to secure a T-Mobile S10+ at the Costco in Syracuse. My plan was to buy the S10+, add it as a new line to take advantage of the $390 prepaid Mastercard, and then swap this SIM into an Iphone 6 that my daughter uses, and swap the SIM from my old S8 into the S10.

In the end... I satisfy all of the criteria (I bought the new S10+ and activated a new line of service), so I figured I'm good to go.

The sales guy (who has been doing this for 10 years, so I'm guessing he knows what he's doing) suggested that I not do this until the rebate card is approved.

He called his boss, who said that as long as the new SIM is activated in the new S10, and we can make a test call/text with it, that we should be good. It will effectively activate the new SIM with the new phone in T-Mobile's system, and all rebates should get approved. Makes sense to me.

I have not made, nor do I plan on making, any line changes (dropping lines, etc). I can't see why this would get rejected, but I'd like to harness the power of REDDIT EXPERIENCE for some feedback.

"10GB SC vs. 10GB SC (SCFMUTT10 vs. NAFUTT4) & Unlimited & Gov't DiscountOK.... here's what I've found out. If you have the 15% gov't discount, and were on the Simple Choice 10GB plan w/ a SOC code of SCFMUTT10, the 15% discount worked. Comes to $102 + tax for the 10GB per line & includes data stash.

But.... if you wanted to partake in the permanent bump up to the Unlimited data, the SCFMUTT10 doesn't allow for that. You need a plan change to another Simple Choice 10GB plan with a SOC code of NAFUTT4. Doing so, either the T-Mo rep can move you to the Unlimited, or you can go in to each of your voice lines and make the switch to Unlimited manually. The bad news... the 15% gov't discount doesn't work with NAFUTT4..... so it will be $120 + tax for the Unlimited.

Both examples above come with 4 lines included.

The OVERALL good news is that the Simple Choice free lines all seem to be surviving the SC to SC plan change, so no worries there.

Again, this is only for the SCFMUTT10 vs. NAFUTT4. Other plans/SOC codes/flavors of Simple Choice may vary.",tmobile

"Just had a very rude experience at a Tmobile store...So to start...a few weeks ago I walked into one of my local Tmobile stores to try out the S10/e/+ and OP6T. I enjoyed using all 4 phones. On the 6T I heard that the fingerprint reader was sometimes unreliable. So I registered my thumb print on the store model and it worked flawlessly. I didn't get anything that day and just walked out after a few minutes.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to today where I went into the same store and one of the reps there whisked me away to the area where the 6T was (I was originally looking at the Samsungs again) The rep remembered me and was pissed that I registered my thumb print because that was the phone they use for music streaming through bluetooth. He said they tried time and time again to unlock the phone via thumbprint but couldn't do it because mine was the only one registered. Funny thing is that music was indeed playing from the store, so not sure why he kept harping on the inability to play music.

&#x200B;

He also insisted that I had to have created an unlock pattern as a backup way to unlock the phone. First off I NEVER EVER use patterns. I've always used a 4 digit pin. Even if I had to create a pattern I would have just done anything and never remembered it. The rep insisted that I must know the pattern and he kept egging me on to unlock it. I couldn't help and told him that he could ask me the question over and over again but I won't know the pattern. He remained pissed and just said ""ok whatever"" and walked away. I then walked out of the store. I wasn't planning on getting a new phone today but overall I was treated with disrespect and rudeness. It might not sound like much but the guy was really rude and stern with me. If and when I do get a new phone I certainly won't go to that store. They lost me as a customer.

&#x200B;

Ok now I ask the rest of this sub reddit and Tmob employees...can they really not unlock a demo / store model phone? If so couldn't you contact One Plus to get another demo phone in the store? I understand that I made a mistake by not deleting my thumbprint and apparently making the phone unusable for others, but I didn't do it on purpose and would think that for a demo phone they have a way of getting around that.

&#x200B;

Is there somewhere or someone I can tell this story to? I want to make it clear that I don't want the rep fired. I don't even know his name but perhaps some coaching or additional training? Gotta admit that was the worst retail experience I've had at Tmob and the worst retail experience anywhere in quite some time. I don't have Twitter but maybe there is someone I can call or email?

"iPhone XS Max and Dual Sim eSIM data problemsI have an iPhone XS Max (A2101) purchased in Europe. I am using a European carrier's physical SIM card and a TMobile prepaid eSIM which I use for voice and data. Unfortunately, when the physical SIM card is active, the data flow to the TMobile eSIM is terrible. It's laggy, choppy, and I am unable to hold Google Hangout meetings or use Facetime for audio or video conversations because it cuts in and out repeatedly. It's also laggy as hell for Brawl Stars. Any sort of application that requires a constant flow of data will suffer. I've tried it in three metropolitan cities across the US (NY, Dallas, and SF).

&#x200B;

Once I eject the physical SIM or disable it (by not entering the physical SIM's PIN, for example), the TMobile eSIM works perfectly. Originally I didn't suspect it was a hardware problem at first so I had TMobile reprovision my eSIM twice. Therefore, I am now on my 3rd eSIM but the problem is still there.

"TMobipe Wont/Can't Unlock PhoneI bought a TMobile locked iPhone (that she got from the T-Mobile store) off of Craigslist recently. I talked to the lady some before we met up and she agreed to meet at the TMobile store and have them unlock it before selling it to me. We're at the store and the lady pays off her last bills on the phone and one of the employees says that were all set and that I should receive two emails, one in 24 hours confirming that the phone will be unlocked and another in 48 hours with the code to unlock it. The lady gives me the phone and we both head home

Sounds good

I wait a day and a a few hours and I get an email from TMobile. The email basically says that the phone can't be unlocked because ""the device is not in use with the corresponding phone number."" I call up the T-Mobile store we met at and they said it's not really something they can deal with and to have the account owner to contact there customer service. At this point I was kind of scared because I was half expecting the lady that sold it to me to ghost and that she wouldn't help me fix any problems. I was wrong and she was super helpful. She called them and from what I understand they said it was a problem on apples part. She then contacts apple and they tell her there's no reason for it not to be unlocked and something along the lines of notifying T-Mobile to update their database. 

She then calls t mobile and they tell her to wait another day. The next day she calls them and they tell her they'll sort it all out and that the unlock code will be sent in 24 hours. Que to this evening where it's been well over a day. She calls them again and asks what's up and they say it can't be unlocked right now and to call back tomorrow.

I've been without a functional phone for about a week now and I'm getting a little irritated (old one won't charge). I'm not mad at anyone in particular in fact the employees at the T-Mobile store I was calling seemed to be pretty helpful, but I need this to get sorted out asap and by the looks of it, I get the feeling that T-Mobile is trying not to have this phone unlocked. The lady throughout this whole ordeal has been super helpful. She's been sending me screenshots of the support tickets and updating me about everything and even offered me a refund and to keep the phone if they can't get this sorted out, but I don't want any of that, I just want this fixed!

Sorry for the rant, I'm just not really sure what any steps are after this if they continue to not unlock it.

"Feel like T-Mobile gypped me out of $300 due to JOD and poorly written agreementsBack in February, when they announced the new Galaxy S10's, I decided I wanted to upgrade from my Galaxy S8 and I looked at the great deal that Samsung was offering and the OK deal that T-Mobile was offering and decided to go with T-Mobile so I wouldn't end up with another line of credit on my reports, etc.  I did the online upgrade and after answering the questions was told I'd get about $350 for my trade in.  Fast forward to just now  and as I was about to print my return label I noticed that it said the accepted value was $60.  I called T-Mobile and was told that I had one $24 payment left on my S8, so I couldn't get the trade in deal.  All I could get was a $60 bill credit for my old device.  I asked where in the offer did it say I had to have the phone completely paid off and she said that *it may not have been clearly stated anywhere I read*.  I'm so angry about this, I feel like I really need to send the S10 back, keep my S8, and switch to Verizon.  I've been with T-Mobile/VoiceStream/PowerTel since 1998, but now I think it may finally be time to part ways with magenta.    By the way, I thought about upgrading last year, but at the time it clearly stated that I had to have a least half of my phone paid off.  To make this happen, I sent in an additional payment and  a half to apply to my EIP.  I would have easily paid this last payment if I had seen anywhere that I needed it for the trade in.        





TLDR: T-Mobile didn't honor my trade-in value due to JOD terms that they didn't make clear to me  ",tmobile

"What’s the catch for the Simple Choice Unlimited upgrade by 3/16. Opt out or let it roll?I am currently on SC NA UTT+10GB each 4 Lines for $120 with 2 free data for life tablet plans (one the 200mb, the other is an up to a 5gb primary line data match for $10/month).  I don’t tether often nor have I really used the data stash.  I work from home so always had the data stash in case the internet went out ... but in 4 years have only used my phone a couple times for backup data.

Are there any catches that I am missing or should consider?  I am sure there is something in it for tmo or they wouldn’t be doing this.  I will still have 10 gb per line per month for tethering + 5gb from my tablet if I ever did need it, it says data lines are not impacted, so I can’t see a downside since I don’t need the data stash, but worried I am missing something.

"tmobile support now gives tax advice! so cool!so I've been paying $50/month for the past 6-8 months for the $50 prepaid service. It's been $50 every month. $50 flat.

&#x200B;

So my payment was due yesterday, but for some reason my paypal card wouldnt let the payment go through. I decided to just skip the payment and wait till this morning to deal with it.

&#x200B;

So this morning I called paypal and fixed the issue, and when I went into my tmobile account to pay for it, the amount due was $54.90. Slightly more than the usual $50 i pay.

&#x200B;

So naturally I called support to ask why the sudden change in price. They told me it was because of taxes.

Then I asked ""are these new taxes? ""

&#x200B;

rep: ""no these are sales tax""

&#x200B;

me: ""ok, but why is it being charged this month but not the previous 8 months""

&#x200B;

me: ""do you understand english?""

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

me: ""ok then, so my original question was why are these taxes being charged this month but not the previous 8 months""

&#x200B;

rep: ""sir the only way you were paying $50 a month is if you were on the $45 plan""

me: ""i can see that, but you clearly do not understand my question""

me: ""sir it is illegal to sell cocaine in the united states""

so I was frustrated at this point. So I opened up chat support and chat support explained to me why I was being charged that amount.

basically if you change your plan for even just a day you will be charged taxes for the new plan, but wont be charged the taxes in the following months as long as you stay on that plan.

"SC unlimited upgrade option (by 3/16) international roaming unlimited?So I'm in the minority among this group in that I use very little of my 6GB data since I stay on wifi most of the time. I also almost never tether. But I am planning an international vacation for a month where I think I would both use lots of data and potentially tether a lot. I don't think I'd ever use the 20GB data stash or tether stash I typically have every month, but it would be nice to have that extra data. So I don't know if there's really a benefit for me going to unlimited data and dropping my tethering down to 6gb only a month. 

I don't use tethering much or much of any of my 6gb of data that rolls overs to 20gb data stash frequently, but can't get over the fact that I'd lose the data stash tethering if I switched to unlimited. Seems to be the only down side. 20GB is a ton of free data for tethering. But if I don't use it, seems like there's no point in not switching to unlimited with the 6gb tethering data cap.

"T-Mobile Site Equipment GuideHere is the T-Mobile site equipment guide for the first half of 2019. Keep in mind, antennas can vary greatly, even within one's market. Not all sites use the same equipment. It is not uncommon to find ""legacy"" equipment on T-Mobile sites outside of major markets. Legacy equipment will not be posted in this guide, as I am attempting to make it a simple post for the most common equipment seen on T-Mobile's sites today.

&#x200B;

To start off, let's begin with Remote Radio Units/Heads (RRU/RRH). These are typically at the top of each site located behind panel antennas to reduce loss between the Base Transceiver Station (BTS) and antenna. 

In Nokia markets, the following RRH models are used:

\- [NSN Flexi Radio](https://imgur.com/UmkNJHG)

\- [NSN AirScale](https://imgur.com/UAX9B1Y) (600/700 or 1900/2100MHz dual-band radio)

In Ericsson markets, the following RRH models are used:

\- [E/// RRUS 11](https://imgur.com/s5NGt9i)

\- [E/// RRUS 12](https://imgur.com/Rql0NYA)

\- [E/// RRUS 4478](https://imgur.com/mTlKhI9) (600/700MHz dual-band radio)

&#x200B;

Since 600MHz is the ""hot topic"" around r/tmobile nowadays, here are some setups I've seen while browsing Reddit:

\- [This is a setup using Ericsson AIR 21 and 32, with an APX panel for B12 and B71](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/atk74b/philly_600_mhz_installs_happening_now/) in Philadelphia. The AIR series antennas have integrated RRHs, hence, there not being radios for those panels. The APX panel is utilizing an Ericsson RRUS 4478 model and is dual-band capable, allowing B12 and B71 to be broadcasted from the same antenna (Credit to u/ERICLRICH). [Here's the APX antenna spec page](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/8xtg08/salt_lake_city_metro_market_b71_details/), posted by u/dmplus in Salt Lake City.

\- In Nokia markets, the setups use various different types of antennas, rather than just a couple different types. [Here is a setup in San Antonio, using a CommScope panel for B12 and B71](https://www.reddit.com/r/tmobile/comments/9nwjkz/new_antenna_spotted_in_san_antonio_tx_photo_inside/), and with a NSN AirScale RRH, which, similarly to Ericsson's RRUS 4478, is dual-band capable (Credit to u/besweeet). Other setups can include, but are not limited to, something like [this](https://imgur.com/QIMKqox) I saw in Tulsa, or like [this](https://imgur.com/4xeAKNc) in Oklahoma City, which are also made by CommScope.

\*Note: Ericsson RRUS 4478 and Nokia AirScale RRHs are NR capable.\*

&#x200B;

PCS/AWS (B2/B4) antenna setups in Ericsson markets typically do not vary within major metro areas. Most commonly, the setup will include AIR 21 for AWS/B4, and if the site has been upgraded, AIR 32 for PCS/B2, which can enable 4x4 MIMO. [Here's an example site in Salt Lake City](https://imgur.com/BglYHD1) (CommScope B12 panel in the middle), featuring AIR 21 and AIR 32. As I stated previously, RRHs are not visible, as they are already integrated within the antenna unit itself.

&#x200B;

700MHz antenna setups in Ericsson and Nokia markets typically use a CommScope panel that is relatively easy to identify. In the example picture from Salt Lake City, you can see a B12 panel squeezed in between both AIR panels.

&#x200B;

As for Nokia PCS/AWS setups, they can vary a lot. Therefore, I won't go into detail about it. Any questions or comments should be redirected to the discord server, per r/tmobile mods, in cooperation with new subreddit rules and guidelines.

"Has anyone experienced this?Yesterday I was checking our usage detail in the T-Mobile app. One line showed phone calls and texts at 3:45 AM to Bahrain, Italy and New Jersey. What’s even more strange is that they were the same phone even thought it showed three different countries. 

I started checking the other lines and five out of our six lines showed the same calls and texts to the same countries, same number at the same time. 

I immediately called customer support who were extremely useless. They transferred me to technical support who said I should be talking to customer support who I asked not to transfer me who said let me check your account and without warning transferred me back to technical support. I hung up, called back and asked for a supervisor. Was put on hold forever and a day for a regular representative to come back to the phone. 

Anyway, is it possible that my numbers have been cloned? Do I have any malware? They are all iPhone X Max s if that makes any difference.

"T-Mobile asking for a deposit for new wireless service, even though I have great credit?Hey guys,

I'm trying to ditch AT&T because they are too expensive, and saw that T-Mobile is a pretty great deal. I have a family plan right now with 3 lines of unlimited data for $160 a month. T-Mobile is offering unlimited data with T-Mobile ONE, buy 2 lines get the 3rd line free. So 3 lines of unlimited data for $120 a month (with autopay).

I called up and said I was ready to make the switch. I told the super nice lady that I wanted to bring my own 3 devices, and just needed service and the SIM cards. She checked my IMEI numbers, said the phones were compatible, checked my numbers, and said they were portable, so she started taking down my information.

All was well until we got to the credit check, she said everything looks good, BUT I need to put down a line deposit for each line. $75 for the first line, $55 for the second line, and $25 for the third line. She said that I would get my full $155 deposit back after paying my bill on time for 12 months in a row. When I asked why the deposit was needed, she gave me a vague ""it happens sometimes with customers who have not so good credit"" answer. What doesn't make sense to me is that my credit is great. As of today, my score is 800 with Transunion, and 807 with Equifax.

I asked her if the credit report she was looking at had any helpful information, basically... ""what's wrong with my credit?"" She said she can't tell me because it won't share any information with her for security reasons. Don't get me wrong, $155 is not a lot of money, so it's not the end of the world. What turns me off is that one of the reasons I want to go to T-Mobile is because there are no contracts.

T-Mobile holding my $155 for one year kind of feels like... well, a contract? I asked her... ""what if it turns out I don't like the service? What if reception is bad at my house? Or at my job? What if I find a better deal somewhere else?"" She said I would simply lose the $155 if I left T-Mobile before the 12 months are up.

I don't understand it. I don't want to finance any devices, I'm not asking them for a $1,000 phone to go along with the service or anything, I just want service and 3 SIM cards. I literally called T-Mobile and said ""here, please take my money. I want to give you $120 a month, plus $75 for the SIM cards, plus I want to sign up for auto-pay, here is my debit card."" And... T-Mobile said ""sure, thanks, but first we need an extra $155 from you. Don't worry you'll get it back a year later."" So here I am now, looking at Sprint and other options. T-Mobile not taking my money lol.

My question is, has anyone else experienced this with T-Mobile when signing up for their service? Is there anything I can do or anyone I can talk to to circumvent the line deposits? It just doesn't make any sense. Any advice would be appreciated. Thanks!",tmobile
"Google voice not ringingI use Google voice on T-Mobile, and have for years. Fewer and fewer of my calls are getting through. As a temporary fix, I am forwarding my Google voice calls to Hangouts, but that seems a bit of a kludge. Aside from forwarding to Hangouts, I have not made any changes to my settings, and the switch to send all calls to voicemail is not checked. I have deleted and reinstalled the app. Discussion boards elsewhere say the move is to call T-Mobile, because T-Mobile has determined that Google voice forwarding is a form of spam, but their customer support is clueless when I have tried. I do not see this question previously answered here. Does anybody have any code words I can use with T-mo?",tmobile

Today I asked Tmobile by Twitter DM to confirm the IMEI of the phone used on my line.

"Coverage in Socal and outing roadsAfter seven years T-Mobile still has zero coverage on sr38 ( Red Lands to Big Bear), sr18 (Irvine Lake to Mission Viejo) and sr74 (San Juan Capistrano to Lake Elsinore). Not to mention spotty coverage while traveling, even with 600 band. Are these spots ever going to get coverage? For the first time in years i'm considering going over to the dark side. Just a month ago I was stuck in traffic during a snow storm in CA-38 for 4 hours on the return trip with no service, moving a couple of feet every 30 minutes. Then on a recent trip to a friends house, I found out there is no service in Irvine close to 133 and portola highway. I bought a s9+ hoping for better coverage, if tmobile does not improve their coverage in these areas. I think that it would be time to switch. I understand not having coverage in areas away from highways and civilization. But, not having and not improving coverage in seven years in these trafficked routes is pushing me to switch.

"Phone possibly hacked? I'm not sure how this is possibleSo yesterday I got a phone call from t-mobile customer care saying I had bought an iphone and whether I had approved the purchase or not. He asked for the six digit pin that was texted to me. I was suspicious since he didn't sound very professional so I did not give him the number and assumed it was a phishing scam spoofing tmobile's customer care number. The odd thing is he knew the last 4 digits of my social. A few hours later I lose network signal, no voice or data. I use wifi to log into my tmobile account online to see if there was anything suspicious. The website says there is no tmobile account registered with this number. So I use my google number to wifi call tmobile customer service.

&#x200B;

I spent two hours trying to communicate with an Indian lady half way round the world over a phone signal that sounds like an AM radio. I could barely understand her and she would repeat things in a slow quiet voice that constantly broke up from the bad signal, sounding utterly confused and unsure of herself each time. I tried to get a manager but she said the manager wouldn't have any more information than she already did on her computer.

&#x200B;

Allegedly someone called them earlier today, pretending to be me, asking for my account information and balance, and subsequently cancelling my voice line while leaving the other lines on the family plan untouched. I asked them how was it so easy for them to cancel my line? She said I had to personally call them to make that decision from my smartphone, the one that's been with me all day, for that to happen. I asked if it was possible they spoofed my number and called them? She said no the system shows my number so it was from my phone line and my smartphone. I asked if I could get my number back. She said it had been ported to wholesale. I asked her what that was and how could it be ported out so quickly? She never answered most of my questions and I could barely make out what she was saying half the time, mainly because she would say it so meekly and uncertainly there was no emphasis on the words. I FINALLY got her to understand I needed a new line to replace the one cancelled under my family plan and told her I was getting a new SIM card from the Tmobile store instead of having her ship it. I almost got nothing out of the exchange, and I wasn't asking for much. Just some basic information. At least the initial ten minutes waiting on hold was rather quick, with plenty of voiceovers touting the quick and smart customer service tmobile provides with their team of ""experts"".

&#x200B;

"Tech Support ScamJust giving a heads up to others out there. I've gotten 6+ phone calls, 4 of those back to back after I rejected them because I didn't know the number and because I was working (It didn't show up as T-mobile, but it did show as one of their numbers after I googled it), but they continued to call. 

Anyways, the number 1-800-937-8997 calls and says They're from T-Mobile tech support they'd like to confirm that I had added 2 lines on new iPhones. They did have the right Name, which is worrisome, but after they put me on hold (after saying they need to talk to me right away lol) I hung up. They haven't called back since then. Hopefully it doesn't happen again. 

Apparently people were doing this as far back as 2014 spoofing the tech support number but it's been popping back up again.

Also a side note, I don't know about you guys, but I have been getting an INSANE amount of spam calls recently. Like 3+ per day some days. I don't know what's been going on, but it's ridiculous. ",tmobile

"New rules and guidelines for the T-Mobile SubredditHi folks!

&#x200B;

The mod team has decided to change things up a bit in terms of pinned posts and content rules. The new changes are as follows:

&#x200B;

* **Speed tests** are now only allowed on **Mondays**. There will be a pinned post for them once a week every Monday. Speed tests posted on any other day (unless in the dedicated post) will be removed. This is mostly in line with the existing rule, except now the speed test megathread will only be pinned on Monday.

&#x200B;

* The **T-Mobile Tuesdays** megathread will only be pinned for that Tuesday, and the rest of the week it will not be. If there are any special Tuesday events it may stay pinned a bit longer.

&#x200B;

* **New Rule**: ""Who's on this tower?"" posts and pictures are no longer allowed in the subreddit. They're getting a bit spammy. We do however encourage them on the discord server (linked below). **EDIT**: We will be going with a “Tower Fridays” weekly megathread. Look for more info later this week!

&#x200B;

* We will also begin to pin useful or relevant posts throughout the week. If a particular post becomes really popular or has information that many people would find relevant, we will pin it.

&#x200B;

I would also like to take the time to remind everyone our guidelines regarding politically charged content in the sub. We have no rules against political posts or comments, at all, as long as they are relevant to T-Mobile. We do not censor or remove political comments regardless of their content, unless they violate the rules. If you post a comment and it is directly insulting someone or is entirely rude or hateful, it will be removed. Please know that this is not censorship of one political party or another. We want a healthy and thriving community with polite debate, not name-calling and hateful rhetoric. If you see comments, political or not, that violate the rules, please report them. DO NOT report comments just because you disagree with them.

&#x200B;

Please let us know in the comments below if you have any other suggestions or comments about these changes. Thanks!

It’s probably my most expensive “unneeded bill”. By this I mean I need water. I need a house. Etc

20 add a line for one phone

10 digits line for Apple Watch (pointless)

18.25 for T-Mobile fees and charges (ya right)

Are these quirks normal? The T-Mobile employee says it could be a phone boot up thing because the T-Mobile animation isn't on my phone. And Samsungs aren't known to play nice with SMS and MMS messaging on T-Mobile's network.

"Unlocked S9 and Visual VoicemailRead through a bunch of threads and just want to verify what I found.

I had a Huawei that did not play well with T-Mobile, specifically the lack of VoLTE support. Members here and other forums suggested I get a phone that supports VoLTE and band 71, so I picked up an unlocked S9 from Best Buy. Everything now works perfectly except Visual Voicemail access in the Samsung dialer. So I installed the T-Mobile VVM app as suggested by others.

So, is the T-Mobile app the only way to access Visual Voicemail, or is there a way to integrate that into the Samsung dialer?",tmobile
"Technical network question if anybody can please helpIs there any logical reason why voice over LTE (VoLTE) would cause distortion on calls over Bluetooth but not over a handset on an iPhone X with AirPods? I’ve been working with Apple and they seem to believe it’s a VoLTE issue causing the interference but I’m not buying it. If it were a network issue, the distortion would surely be happening when the call is made or received directly from the handset without Bluetooth being a factor. 

Better explanation: 
iPhone + Bluetooth + VoLTE = distortion.
iPhone + Bluetooth + WiFi calling = distortion.
iPhone - Bluetooth + VoLTE = no distortion.
iPhone - Bluetooth + WiFi calling = no distortion.
iPhone + Bluetooth - VoLTE = no distortion but dropped calls.

Apple claims it’s a T-Mobile issue which doesn’t make sense.

"Not sure whether to post here or r/scams. Asked for e-sim so I could pop in a second physical sim while traveling. Got physical simBought a new unlocked iPhone XS and took it to a T-Mobile store to buy a plan. I was very explicit about what I wanted, and it seemingly took a lot of extra work. We discussed in detail that I needed T-Mobile to use the e-sim so that when I travel I can install a physical sim from a local carrier. They said that they couldn’t do that in the store, but that Customer Care could do it. The system was down so I had to come back a second time. The woman was on the phone with Customer Care for a long time. Lot of back and forth and finally I got my phone back with the T-Mobile plan. I never saw her install a physical sim, but now I am in Europe and I open up the phone and there is a T-Mobile sim in the slot and no sign of esim. When I put a European Vodaphone sim in the slot, any sign of T-Mobile disappeared. I can’t believe this happened.

"Switching to Xfinity Mobile, bye fam!Been with T-Mobile for about four years. It's been alright, but it's time I switch to something more reliable. I drive for Uber sometimes and the amount of dead spots with T-Mobile was super frustrating and caused me problems with trying to start/end trips. I got a cheap secondary phone on Xfinity Mobile 6 months ago, and so far so good. Last week I started using that phone for Uber and it's so much better. No dead spots! Woohoo! So I decided to switch my primary phone and so I have a Galaxy S10e on order from Xfinity Mobile.

I will definitely miss how fast T-Mobile's network is... according to Speedtest, it's like 10x faster almost everywhere... but I'd rather have mediocre speeds all the time than excellent speeds sometimes and absolutely no service sometimes.

I did appreciate how friendly T-Mobile support was - though sometimes it seems like they don't know what they are doing and the same problem requires multiple phone calls to resolve. Most recently, I purchased a hotspot which was completely useless from day one after the system kept thinking it was a SyncUP Drive so it didn't actually work. I'd contact support, they'd fix it, and a few days later it would stop working again. Oh well, I cancelled the line, got refunded for the last few months of service, and sold the hotspot to my friend (it worked with a Project Fi SIM, which is cool!).",tmobile

Today, I went to my local T-Mobile store to have my phone unlocked. I paid off my device in FULL and within a few hours I received an email from T-Mobile with some instructions I need to follow (after waiting 48 hours) to complete the unlock of my phone.

So, I am hoping someone can answer 2 questions for me as this is the VERY 1st time I ever went this route to get a device unlocked and I am VERY unfamiliar with this process.

1. Once the iPhone is unlocked, will i get another notification (email from T-Mobile) letting me know that the unlock is ready? (using the word ""ready"" for lack of a better word here)
2. A sentence in the email instructions from T-Mobile for unlocking my phone seems a bit extreme. It states ""When you have a backup, erase your iPhone. Then plug phone into iTunes and follow setup"". 

Is it really necessary to erase my phone to perform this unlock? It kinda doesn't make sense to me because I am still going to use my T-Mobile SIM. I don't have any other SIM cards to put into the phone (yet).

Does anyone have experience with this that may be able to share some wisdom? It would be greatly appreciated :) ",tmobile

So I just did the T-Mobile eSim postpaid trick and it worked, surprisingly.

So I went on the chat, and told the rep I want to update sim. Gave him the sim number right away and he said “If we're going to replace the current SIM card number that you have on the account. You might experience an interruption of the services. And if we will replace it once done and did not work. You will be needing to buy a new SIM card.” I said well you gotta risk it to get the biscuit and then he said okay sir no problem and he did it.

I went through the process after of adding that cellular plan and updating that link and it accepted it but got an iPhone message saying “Uncertified Plan. This plan is not certified so voice and data services may be affected” I clicked okay and proceeded as normal.

"LG Stylo 3 Plus replacement for my sonSo my son has a phone only because it's free for life. He had a Nexus 5, it died so we got him there stylo 3 plus. He had a tablet but he now uses the phone more and we find now it takes decent pictures but not great and more importantly, the battery dies a lot quicker even when it is in his backpack all day, sometimes full to Dead in a few hours even when not using it.

Was thinking the Stylo 4 but thinking about improving his experience since he is using it more and any extra payments will be offset by turning my tablet cell line off. Kind of want to not go to an iPhone and don't want s10. But don't want the Moto or revel eithier.

Suggestions or recent purchases by others appreciated.

**UPDATE**
I did take my son to the store to look at phones.  Because of the fact I want him to have a good phone for us to go to the Kiss concert with for photos and waiting times, it would never make it by Wed if I ordered online, plus wanted him to have his input within reason.  He held and tested each, not much difference but width, and he liked the Stylo 4, but he didn't want comparable to what he had, so he got in between the V40 and One plus 6T on his own as I let him look at all the phones, except iPhones or S10's.

"Service or Phone Issue?I have an LG V20 that has worked perfectly for the past two years, but just recently it has been having service problems. When I turn the phone on, I get service for about 5 minutes and then it drops all data and goes into ""Emergency Calls Only"" mode. If I leave it alone for some time, it may get service back, but its spotty and constantly drops. Most of the time it says I'm only transmitting data and can't receive any, but still cannot text or call. If I restart the phone I can get service back, but 5 minutes passes and the issues start again. I went into the store and got a new SIM card but the didn't change anything. One of the employees said that I'm on ""Band 10"" which they are phasing out or something of to that degree.

"Executive Care says 2 line 6GB plan ineligible for free unlimited upgradeYep...that’s right. Many of you have received text messages saying you will be upgraded to unlimited data on 3/16 at no additional cost, but the Exec Care team says that’s impossible. I’ve seen people with 2/$80 and 2/$70
6GB plans both receive the message, but the team that’s supposed to be able to fix anything says it’s not going to happen.  

Actually, to clarify even further, Care says no promo accounts are eligible for the free upgrade. So if you aren’t paying full rate for your plan, or if you have free lines, you can’t get unlimited regardless of the text received last week. 3/16 will be an interesting day for sure...

What’s happening to this company?  The one that has preached Uncarrier for years is slowly going through the Recarrier movement now that they are gaining ground on the big 2. If the government allows the merger with Sprint to continue, I look for T-Mobile to quickly become just as bad as all of the other carriers. ",tmobile

When was it released?
When was it discontinued?

What is the best solution for those still on the plan, to get it to work like it should?

"Need a new phone soon. Buy now or wait to see what may be needed for 5G in a few months?My LG G6 keeps randomy shutting down at 20-40% battery. When I try to turn it on it says the battery is completely out, but when I plug it in it says 40% within 2 minutes. Something is wrong with the battery sensor or something. The phone is paid off right now, so I figure I will just get a new one.

Mainly looking at the iPhone XR and the OnePlus 6T. I have never used Apple OS and only have Windows Machines, so I don't really know how the transition would go. My wife is all Apple and says she typically has some trouble when trying to use Windows machines to sync with the iPhone, compared to her Apple machines and the integration.

With 5G coming in the next few months I was wondering if I should just wait to see what comes through. I know it will be a little more expensive, and the selection will be low. Also waiting might mean most 4g phones will become cheaper.

Any advice? I'd like to keep payments low. 

Right now I can trade in my G6 for credits towards the Samsung S10e, but it doesn't really seem like an upgrade to the G6.

Edit: thanks for all the responses. I think I will keep the G6 for now and just be proactive about keeping it charged. I think it may be the cold temps and a messed up sensor.

"My Galaxy S10+ Preorder NightmareAs someone who uses an IPhone I was hyped and exited to finally switch to a new platform. Especially with the great amount of deals, good phone pre release reviews. If only I knew what's about to come.

**How it Began:**

On February 27th, I upgraded my phone through the T-Mobile (US) upgrade program + trade in, signed the EIP and was ecstatic that I'm getting my phone early March (it was somewhat between 7-10th). In 2 days I wanted to check on my order and what do I see? Nothing. It was quite difficult to explain to the Customer Representatives that I have the signed EIP on my hands but the order wasn't placed in the system, mind me saying that it more than 48 hours have passed since that moment.

**Customer Service Call Attempt #1:** Saturday, March 1. After about 15-20 minutes of talking to customer service rep I was told that I need to place another order, and cancel the last EIP if I'll be double charged. *""Thank you, but no.""* How can someone offer such a thing based on vague assumptions that it might or might not happen, and if it happens *YOU deal with it.*

**Customer Service Call Attempt #2:** Saturday or Sunday, March 1-2 (don't quite remember). After nearly an hour. I was told that everything is fine and I'll be getting my device, and the order will appear shortly. ""*Finally, some assurance that everything is fine.""* Thought I. So I decided to wait, a bit more, as was recommended by the customer service rep.

*\*Paranoia Intensifies.\* There are no signs of my order, estimations.*

**Customer Service Call Attempt #3:** Tuesday, March 5. Talking about the issue, nearly one hour. Problem escalated to the supervisor. Call is being dropped by the rep, no follow up call in 15 minutes.

**Customer Service Call Attempt #4:** Tuesday, February 5.  *\*15 minutes after the attempt #3\**. I realize that now I have to explain everything that we spoke about for the past hour to another customer service rep with no possible way to talk to the one before that. *Not giving up.* However this time it's significantly harder to explain what's the issue. Since the customer service rep refuses to believe me, and won't check the signed documents on my end. After about 1h 30min of talks with the supervisor, the issue was identified as some weird system error that processed my EIP and Signature, but didn't pop the order, and that it will 100% be cancelled, and we should place another order or I won't be getting anything. *""At least this time I know for sure that it would be a) done properly. b) I won't be double charged.""* \- Thought I.

However since the order was placed again on March 5th, the estimate shipping date now Is \*\*\*03/27/2019 - 04/02/2019... ""\*\*\**Ummm. April... What?"".* You can probably understand my frustration. From March 7-10 to the Beginning of April? Let's not forget, There's a special promotion from Samsung regarding 130$ Ear Buds that's for preorder only that can be redeemed by some time somewhere in April.. But I'll return to that.

**Customer Service Call Attempt #5:** Thursday, March 7. I'm asking politely to find a way to get my pre-order in an acceptable timeframe. Get Rejected. *<input sadness here>.*

**March 7th. Final Preorder Day.** I get a text message from T-Mobile that states:

*""Hello, Unfortunately, we could not ship your order as we run out of stock (including all other colors). Do not make a new order as our website seems to not be fully updated for all customers. A refund has been processed in case you have been charged, expect it in 3-4 days. Please do not hesitate to email us regarding any issue you have with our services, we will try to respond in less than 24 hours.""*

**Customer Service Call Attempt #6:** Thursday, March 7. They tell me to ignore the message, and I'll be updated on the progress by the end of the week. : /

As of now. My *""Would you recommend T-Mobile to a friend""* dropped from 8 to 1. I'm not sure after all the promises and kind words that I'll be even getting my phone. You might think for a big company like T-Mobile this whole thing would not be an issue... I was never so wrong. I'll make sure I'll finishing this story with hopefully a happy resolution.

**Update #1: March, 7th.** I was recommended to get in touch with a rep via Facebook. So I did. After reviewing everything, I was told that the order was not declined. Everything is tip top. and the rep will get in touch with me next week on Tuesday, to check upon me. *Let's just wait and see now.*

**Update #2: March, 11th.** Still no signs of the situation changing. Just spoke to another Rep, and a superior officer, both say ""You order is on **back order"" & ""we're sorry"".** Basically saying that they will ship the items as soon as they will be available and they can't do anything to speed up the process. Too bad the transition to Samsung is so unnecessary painful.

I've been in phone limbo for the past hour. I called their number and they've spun me around to dozen different departments. From pre-pay to post-pay. From post-pay to pre-pay. Pre-pay to order support. To technical support. To activations. They tell me a different reason each time from they can't lookup my order number to they can't handle returns. The first time I called they were activating my device and tried to charge me again for a second plan.

"Simple Choice grandfathered $20 unlimited and the free unlimited upgradeI currently have a Simple Choice plan with 10 voice lines and 3 data lines. There are 8 voice lines with 4GB of high speed data each (one of which is a ""this one is on us"" line) and 2 voice lines with grandfathered $20 unlimited data with 5GB of tethering each. There are 2 data lines with 5GB high speed ""data match"" and 1 with just 2GB of high speed data. We have a 15% government discount on our account so we pay just over $230 including taxes for the account total each month.

We have not received the text regarding an upgrade of the 4GB lines to unlimited for free. Is this because of the 2 lines that have the old $20 unlimited? If so, can I simply remove the unlimited on those lines and bring them down to 4GB lines and have them all upgraded to unlimited? I'm pretty sure all the lines would then get 4GB of tethering. We would end up saving a decent amount while gaining unlimited on all the lines, with the only negative being that we would drop from 5GB of tethering data to 4GB for the 2 lines, correct?

I'm also going to cancel the 2GB data line since it gets very little usage at this point. If I could end up with 10 voice lines with unlimited high speed data and 4GB of tethering each along with 2 data lines with 5GB each all for under $190 a month, I'd be a happy camper.",tmobile

If it is accurate is there something I'd need to reference when I got to jump to the S10?   If it's not accurate do I need to have a new phone sent out or can I just bring my phone into the store, do the jump and pay the replacement fee at the store?

"Need clarification on data options for my phone lineI'm on a simple choice plan and when I go to TMO website and look at my phone line's data options, I see that I can get 4gb of high speed data for no additional charge, or I can pick 4gb of High Speed data with Enterprise Email for $5.

I don't know what enterprise email is, but is there any difference between the two different 4gb plan, other than the enterprise email and $5 up charge?

The 4gb of high-speed option for free describes 4G LTE data, while the 4gb Enterprise $5 option only says High-Speed.  High-speed and 4G LTE are one and the same right?

If so, I will just stick with the free 4gb one.",tmobile

"What Happens to My BOGO Promo Credits if I Pay Off Phone to Trade in to Best Buy?I hope I can explain this without it being too confusing.

I have a Galaxy S9 that was part of the BOGO free promo last year. The phone has $390 left on its balance and T-Mobile gives me $30 a month in credit to pay for the phone. Best Buy is offering $550 if I trade in the phone towards the S10 but I was told I'd need to unlock my S9 in order for BB to accept it, which I believe means I'd need to pay off the balance on the phone.

If I pay off the remaining $390, does my BOGO free credit disappear as well? My bill on T-Mobile's website says I have 23 monthly credits left. I wouldn't be cancelling my line/number either, I'd just buy an unlocked S10 from Best Buy and activate it through T-Mobile.

I'm hoping to get some clarity on this because I'm tempted to trade in my S8 and S9 since I'd get a total of $850 of trade-in credit at Best Buy.",tmobile

"Giving my S10+ a once-overI just received my s10+. I was giving it a once over just to make sure there are no scratches, etc on this new device. A few things I noticed. First, the screen protector is installed by Samsung, but it still has some dirt and scuffs on it out of the box. Second, on the sides where the metal frame is, apparently they have stuck some protective film all around. Finally and most interesting, I turned on my other phones flashlight and started looking at the screen in detail. Is it me or when you get toward the bottom you can actually see almost like a rectangular hole/cutout in the screen which looks to be exactly where the fingerprint reader is. It's crazy because just under normal light I can't see it, just when using the flashlight.

"Which to choose - 10GB w/Data Stash or Unlimited 4G w/SMH? 

>I was one of many who had their promo plans permanently changed last week courtesy of T-Mobile.  The 10GB High-Speed Data with Data Stash which T-Mobile was bumped to Unlimited Nationwide 4G Data + 10 GB SMH initially through 2/28/19. Now that it is permanent, I am reviewing the pros and cons of each option.  
I don't do a lot of tethering as I have another line with a hotspot device. Most of the users on our plan (kids in HS through college) are around wifi most of the day, but we do have one user whose only source of internet is her phone. I have kept her on the Unlimited option and she doesn't use the hotspot feature.  
When it comes to Binge On or Music Freedom or other features, are there other things to be aware of when choosing one option over the other?  Even though we don't use it too much, are there speed differences for tethering between the two options? Anything else to consider between the two choices?  
Thanks!

"S10 pre-order helpI know this probably isnt the right place for this but I do not know what else to do. 

&#x200B;

My wife and I preordered S10+ on Feb 24. I guess they started running CCs last weekend, and my card got dinged with a fraud alert. I cleared it with my bank, and then did a chat with TMobile the next day to make sure it was reprocessed and everything was good. They assured me it was still estimated to ship 3/6-3/8. 

I still saw order processing, so I dug little deeper and it turns out that the whole order was cancelled. I called and had them confirm my card and make sure everything was ok. The agent didnt seem to speak the best english and didn't seem to see what i was asking about. I decided to get the twitter help involved and he said everything seemed good to go. Then he came back about 20 minutes later and said he did more digging and got a do not honor message for this order. 

&#x200B;

So now I apparently have to reorder. I can try my luck at the store Friday morning, but i have to pre-order to get the phone and i can't do that for an in-store pickup. Pre ordered phones now have an estimated shipping date of 3/27. This is kind of ridiculous. They couldn't move that date up for me.

"Switching from Verizon to T-MobileHello, I am switching from Verizon to T-Mobile using their Get out of the red promotion. I have a few questions that I have been getting mixed answers from the chat agents on T-Mobile. 

1. Will T-Mobile pay off both my lines? I have a Galaxy S9, and my other has an iPhone 8 Plus. Both of these phones are the same price, at $533.28 per phone. Which totals at $1,066.56 that we still owe. 

Reason I'm asking this is because, I heard that only $400 of the $650 go towards the phone. The other $250 goes towards Early Termination Fees (ETFs). 

Problem is, I dont have ETFs at Verizon. I just have to pay off the phones and I'm out. So, will the rest of the $250 be added to cover the phone?

2. When I switch to T-Mobile, am I required to have the T-Mobile ONE PLUS plan. How long do I need stay in that plan? After T-Mobile sends me the money to pay off the phones? 

3. Am I able to reduce the plan to T-Mobile One? I have no need for the Hotspot or do I travel, so I don't need the ONE PLUS plan. 

I hope you guys can answer these questions as I am really deciding whether or not to switch over. This promotion is very tempting to say the least and would result in a lower monthly plan. 

Thank you for taking the time to read and answer my questions. 

Edit: One more question. When is the time to switch? My next bill is on the 26th. Do I switch before that day to avoid any extra charges? Or how does that work?",tmobile

"Costco Trade-in Deal for Galaxy S10Here's a link to the deal:

[http://membershipwireless.com/content/offer13](http://membershipwireless.com/content/offer13)

&#x200B;

Question:

I have a Oneplus 6T bought back in November, directly from T-Mobile. Got the $300 worth of bill credits spread over 24 months. I have since paid off the phone (and verified that the EIP is satisfied). Can I now use that phone as a part of this trade-in deal? Will Costco still give me the $390 trade-in deal on the 6T, even though I am still receiving bill credits on the 6T for another 19 months? Or will something in their system prevent me from getting the trade-in deal? T-Mobile has confirmed that I will receive the bill credits thru their completion, but said that my existing deal will prevent me from being eligible for any future deals. I'm  just not sure if that is future deals ANYWHERE, or future deals JUST THRU T-MOBILE.

Our website is [**here**](https://howmobileworks.com/spectrum/) and along the right-hand side of the page is the “FIPS By County List”. FIPS is simply the federal county ID number assigned to every county. Download that Excel spreadsheet to find your county, or one you’re interested in.

If you don't see a particular county, it is probably due to the expected TV repack date being in 2020. It will probably show up in a later update to this list.
