"Trying to cancel Comcast, said Moving out of CountrySo I'm moving literally tomorrow, short notice and short on time. I read online that one of the easier ways to start the process is by telling them that you're moving out of the country to where they possibly don't service.

I told them Gothunberg Sweden because pewdiepie did a video about his hometown a day or two ago and I figured why not.

Retention rep of course presses for more info and wants an address. I was at work trying to get it done while opening up the store so I had an excuse to just tell him to call back later or that I'd call back later.

Should I just use a fake address generator for a swedish address or just call back and cut the bullshit and tell them I'm switching to verizon cause fuck em? ",Comcast

"How to Lower Your Cable Bill and Get the Best Deals(Edit: If you’re DMing me for personal advice, just know that I’m doing this off the clock and there’s literally 20 dms per hour. I love helping you guys fight back but give me time to get to you.)

As a retention agent and milling around on these boards I always get asked every day how to reduce your cable bill.

It’s really easy. It doesn’t require threatening or arguing, yelling at a manager or retention agent either.

I read blogs about how to reduce your cable bill and I laugh because it’s misguided.

You ever wonder why you and your neighbor has the same service but different price? 

Let me tell you why.


Comcast’s deals are available because of a simple algorithm. It doesn’t care if you’ve been a customer for 1 year or 30.
It doesn’t care if you pay your bill on time or if you’re late and get shut off every month.

It simply wants to know what services you have and positions you to upgrade at better value or situationally if you are going to be another subscriber loss.

Simply put if you don’t have a service you can always upgrade at a lower cost.

Let’s take internet for instance. Say you had 100mbps at regular price, say $100. You’re thinking to yourself, “Fuck this my mom has 200 for $50 Comcast can ligma.”

Well if you were to upgrade to TV and Internet you could get 100 mbps and TV for $60 as an upgrade OR be a disconnect potential and get the same deal your mom has. 

Basically you get deals on plus-oneing.

It’s all in the system right from the start before you even get off of hold to talk to me.

Just ask for the retention offers for your particular package you already have if you’re not interested in upgrading. And once yo know what they are, hang up, call back and say someone in the store offered it to you. We’ll honor it.

Say you have TV and Internet and you see a new customer deal for TV and Internet right? Well you’re not eligible cause you have it already. Sucks to be you.

Well just disconnect TV and go internet only for a day, and the system will tell me you don’t have TV and you will be eligible for those TV and internet deals.

Pretty funny once you see it from this side.

And agents will say “Oh well if you disconnect you’re not eligible for x amount of days.

That’s true, you’re not supposed to be eligible. 

But if I have low sales for the month or I want to hit a mark for an incentive you’re going to get that deal from me. And as someone who is the top seller in my building, no boss ever said “you have too many sales, get in my office”

Someone is desperate to get a RGU (revenue generating unit) sale. The 60 day restriction is like getting a ticket for jaywalking. You ain’t getting one.

Let me give a storied example:

One day a buddy of mine in office took a TV disconnect cause he didn’t get a disconnect all day and called the guy out. Well he wasn’t bluffing. We laughed at the end of the call and I was telling him he was stupid for hardballing the guy. 

Buddy at work left at 4pm and the disconnect guy calls back, gets me and asked what to do with the cable boxes.

I asked why he disconnected and the dude said it’s just too expensive for me.

I told him well I’m sorry we were not flexible, how about TV and 200 mbps internet for $69 if we keep your business? He was ecstatic and I got a sale and all I had to do was reactivate his cable boxes he already had.

This man went from roughly $180/month to about $90 FOR THE SAME SERVICE HE HAD in about 4 hours. All because of the dumb sales system. NO CONTRACT EITHER.

"Netgear CM1000: Need help decoding logs, Xfinity has been unreliableEver since Comcast raised the equipment fee to $13, I decided to get my own equipment, the Netgear CM1000-1AZNAS and a Google Wifi. This was a few months ago. They might have been overkill considering I'm on the 60Mbps, but I figure Docsis 3.1 could be helpful eventually, since I work from home, and would love faster uploads.

&#x200B;

So for the past 2 weeks, sometimes my Internet some days is very slow, or not usable at all. A quick 1 minute unplug of the modem and or router usually did the trick, but today was pretty painful.

&#x200B;

I was trying to diagnose whether it was the router, or modem, and determined it was the modem (I plugged my TV straight into the modem, and sometimes, it would not work at all, or would be very slow (6Mbps instead of 60Mbps). The 6 sounds ok, but real world use was terrible.

&#x200B;

Eventually, for some reason, the Internet was starting to look good, so I tried to connect Google Wifi to my modem again, and I guess the modem lost connection, so Google recommended I unplug the router for 5 minutes instead of my usual 1, and that seemed to finally do the trick.

&#x200B;

So I have 2 questions

&#x200B;

1. What's the difference between unplugging for 1 minute vs 5? Does IP reset or something happen at 5, which could help more than 1 minute?
2. Do you see anything odd about my logs? Does it look more like Netgear causing performance, or Comcast side?

"Data usage question and concernsWe were just recently hit with the typical bill increases after our first year of a two year contract and opted in to dropping our DVR/HD TV services which also resulted in us swapping boxes in January. Since the box swaps and bill changes our data usage has been quite a bit more than normal and it makes absolutely no sense.

Our usage looks something like this:

Oct 2018 - 248 GB

Nov 2018 - 400 GB

Dec 2018 - 383 GB (We added a fire stick between Nov & Dec)

Onwards to 2019 where we had the box/DVR/HD programming changes:

Jan 2019 - 684 GB (probably 100GB+ of content downloads so not shocked here)

Feb 2019 - 528 GB (shortest month of the year?)

Mar 2019 - 517 GB

And the biggest shocker to me which prompted this post today is the fact that at the end of the ***first day of April I'm already at 33GB*** with about 4 games of League of Legends and maybe 4-5 hours of streaming last night.

We never use the box for streaming Netflix at the same time as the fire stick. It's always one or the other and never both. This is also not 4K streaming.

Is Comcast carrying over data from the previous month even though they are showing it as April 1 - April 30?

It's almost as if they saw one month of data usage that I already knew was going to be high and started following the trend.",Comcast

"Comcast Does NOT Support DOCSIS 3.1 In Full - Request for Comments and Information.Hi guys! If you found this post because you're experiencing issues with your DOCSIS 3.1 device and the Xfinity network, I suggest you open a case with Netgear and confirm loss of block sync with them as an ISP issue, and call the escalation department at (215) 665-1700. Present this fact to Comcast and make sure Netgear keeps the ticket open. The ""system"" that Tier 1 technical support has access to will simply result in you wasting your time as they stone wall you into trying to send a technician into your home so they can sell you their combo box. Don't waste your time (need it be said?).

So, I am gathering as much information about Comcast and their ability to support modems like the Netgear CM1000 or other common consumer DOCSIS 3.1 modem in particular service locales. Specifically, the inability of the CMTS associated to the residential node you are connected through to support ""certified"" 3rd-party equipment from manufacturers such as Netgear at ""Gigabit"" speeds in a residential area on a residential Gigabit connection/service level. I do not believe they support this 3rd party equipment in the manner they advertise. I have an ongoing ticket with Netgear in which we are working to compile information for these issues. It's clear this service tier is being sold to customers without appropriate support for this type of service or device. Over a 30 day period, I have measured the upstream power levels from my modem to the CMTS I am connected to (a Cisco CMTS in my case) at 2 different times in the day which are considered peak Time of Use. Measurements include the correlation of increasing upstream transmit power from my modem to the CMTS, associated with a rapid increase in uncorrectable codewords and rapidly degrading SNR which is correlated with time over a 1 hour period - 30 minutes before and ending 30 minutes after the peak Time of Use for my area. The modem experiences rapidly increasing T3/T4 time outs during these periods of time. If the modem upstream power level begins to be too hot, the modem enters a state of intermittent connectivity with SNR below 30dB across all downstream channels and will not run faster than ~15Mb/ps. Eventually, the device completely loses connectivity and complete loss of block sync as it tries to reboot and range correctly. This results in an inability to range and lock any downstream channel with acceptable signal and resulting in the device completely losing connectivity. This has happened since I have started service with Comcast. No other cable ISP has this issue with this device. The device begins to work again, approximately a day after maintenance is over (24hrs+ after maintenance end). This is guaranteed to happen in my situation when Comcast performs maintenance in my area (scheduled or not). It also can happen during the peak time of use scenarios I described. To me this indicates a lack of capacity at the node servicing my area for this service tier, or further faults at the CMTS. Comcast does not seem to employ technicians on phone support who understand the terminology I am using in this post, making it impossible to get actual support, even when you request repeatedly to speak to the appropriate department. This is not acceptable. Comcast refuses to provide a technical resolution to the issue, and uses psychological tactics and manipulation (altering the context of the discussion to frame me in a certain way, attempting to accuse me of requesting unreasonable accommodation, doing anything and everything to get me off the phone, arguing with me in every way they can so as to get me off the phone and get their eyes back on the bottom dollar.

Comcast employees, if you're reading this: You lost my SSN, locked me out of my account less than a month after account creation because my personal account credentials were suddenly signing me into someone elses account (I am not kidding) while refusing to even tell me where to find my own account number & repeating at me that I must ""visit a store"" apparently (to the point at which I could not even ask where to find my account number as no employee would answer this question until I called billing anonymously, gave the last 4 of my card on file and was able to receive the account number for the security department which would repeatedly just hang up on me), associated my credit card details to a different account less than a month after I started service with you. This incompetency is alarming. Cease operations as the incompetent ISP you are and fund Municipal Broadband and classify yourself as a Title II Common Carrier and remove your data caps for all customers. Doing anything less of this poses a threat to the public with the inability to handle personal information.

To compound this, your agents have repeatedly, on recorded calls: Ignored me, hung up on me after ignoring me while I can hear them typing, at one point cited to me a ""federal law"" as their reasoning for having data caps (on a call with the Billing department) which I insisted on being informed about. Only to have the employee say things like ""well, its in the 'Comcast Database'"" and things like ""All countries have laws"" (that was somewhat amusing, I'll admit), then proceeding to ignore me, then put me on hold and then hang up the call on me. This was recorded. I'm still waiting to hear where in the United States Code this law exists, or what FTC/FCC or other federal regulation your employee was referring to. The employee was referring to the AUP and not willing to admit that, I am sure. I have had 9 call backs scheduled and provided Comcast with 2 phone numbers to reach me at. No call backs have ever been made to me from Comcast. 

I could go on.

If you have had issues with a DOCSIS 3.1 device on the Xfinity network, you are entitled to support after you have exhausted your own troubleshooting options with the manufacturer. If they tell you that ""Advanced Repair only works on Comcast devices"", point out to them that the terminology used in the description of the troubleshooting process for customer owned hardware outlines the fact that after completing said troubleshooting, that if the issue is due to the Xfinity network you are entitled to support as the device is certified to work on their network. Comcast discourages customers with psychological tactics designed to manipulate and wear down the consumer to the point of giving up. Comcast is not a competent ISP.

A resolution that Comcast does not want you to pursue is the establishment of even the most basic SLA with a provider like MegaPath (Fusion) constituting best effort uptime on a coaxial connection. It is my understanding that Comcast would be obligated to fix this issue if it were to be presented to them by working professionals in this industry at that level if indeed it is Comcast infrastructure failure and not unaddressed signal ingress due to RF interference, water, etc.

If you have experienced an issue with your DOCSIS 3.1 device on the Xfinity network, feel free to outline your experience here as I had a supervisor from Adv. Repair more or less request this type of information in a roundabout way. This is the first public post I am making on this matter and I have extensive sets of data and follow up to perform. It is my personal goal to establish municipal broadband services and increase the availability and quality of service from providers such as Wireless ISPs (WISPs) after the impact this has had on my life. Any and all data related to incidents like I've described is welcome and will assist me in my goal.

Thank you very much.

"Why I'm no longer a Comcast supporterBack about a year ago, I signed up for Comcast's Gigabit Pro service. I was delighted to have such great internet at my home, and at a super low cost. I told everyone about it. Talked about it twice on Reddit, [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/7x6qr6/gigabit_pro/) and [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/homelab/comments/8au2n2/before_and_after_of_my_metroe_home_demark/). Posted in industry-specific Facebook groups. Even referred colleagues to sign up. In total, I believe the account rep I was sending these people to had at least 10 people calling him looking to get it set up. No matter how many people told me Comcast was the devil, I was there telling them otherwise. Telling them how great Comcast was. How they're becoming the best ISP in the world. It took a lot for me to say that, as a great friend runs a small local ISP.

About 2 months ago, I decided to move. Called Comcast, explained to the agent that I had an odd account. Was told that it wouldn't be an issue, would be moved without a problem. Called again, confirmed again. Of course, on installation day, the subcontractor cable guy had no idea what I was even talking about. 3 hours later, I settled for cable internet with the idea they'd actually hold up their end of the promise.

2 months after moving, I still don't have my Gigabit Pro service and Comcast is refusing to even look into my case where 2 of their agents told me that it would be moved just fine. Comcast is saying that since it's a specialized service, they do not have the permission to tell customers it'll be moved.

Now, they're telling me I never had it. They (specifically Hakeem, from the escalations department, who's a total brick wall) cannot explain why I had a Juniper ACX2100 on the account. They cannot explain why I paid a $500 installation fee. They cannot explain why there's fiber at a random apartment in Scranton, Pennsylvania. They cannot explain why they can't go back and listen to the 2 calls from when I confirmed the move.

What they can explain is how they're unwilling and unable to do anything at all to waive, decrease, or defer $5,612* of charges they're claiming it would take to get service installed at my residence. No matter how many times I bring up [this screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/C4TQavj.png), where it was confirmed that I'd have no problems with my new address, they won't even apologize. Great way to treat a paying cheerleader.

(* = $1,012 construction costs, $1,000 installation fee, and $3,600 of additional monthly charges)


Edit: Shoutout to Matt in the executive customer relations team. He was finally able to understand that I did have Gigabit Pro. However, he's still unable to understand how call recording laws work or actually uphold their agents promise. ""Specialized service"" my ass.

"Any Experiences Filing a BBB Complaint and/or FCC Complaint?After years of nightmares regarding service and billing issues with Comcast/Xfinity, I finally filed a BBB complaint a couple weeks ago. I could tell this was likely an exercise in futility, from what I had already read from others online. However, I am forced to use their services and don't have unlimited funds to pay whatever they demand for the same lackluster service since April 2014. 

The woman handling the BBB complaint, Alethia Edwards, and I discussed the ongoing services and billing problems with my account. She said she would do some research, and be back in touch. She called about a week later, last Thursday, but I missed the call. I called her around 8am Friday morning, and again on Monday morning, leaving voicemails each time. By then I was having technical services issues again as well. 

 Ms. Edwards was supposed to be handling this matter for once and for all, never returned my calls to her. She wrote back to the BBB incorrect information on Monday, and stated everything was resolved. WRONG. Since then, I've left her a voicemail stating such, and wrote back to the BBB why I why I consider the matter unresolved. I doubt I'll hear back on that, because Comcast can't follow through on any promise. From her notes, and the errors, I doubt she looked into much of anything. 

She did tell me that she should would also be handing the FCC complaint, if I filed one.  Perhaps, she and I will speak again in the future. If so, I expect nothing but more of the bs, placating and now blaming me for their problems with training, service, infrastructure, billing and supervisors who don't seem to do anything but focus on metrics, sales, and some kind of weird cheer-leading I hear in the background. It must suck to work there. I thought pep rallies ended in high school. Not to mention. the agents who are actually trying to hear customers on their crappy VIOP lines for the few that actually try to do a decent job.

"Comcast TV and home securityHi all. I am in Colorado Springs and I am looking to order Comcast for TV and home security, but not for internet. We have FTTP fiber internet that is much better than Comcast's. My question is about the TV service without bundling Comcast internet. Will On-Demand be affected negatively? I know I cannot use the voice remote for some reason, but I want to make sure I will still have access to shows and movies On Demand like I did when I bundled the internet.

"This new channel lineup changeI was trying to watch one of my favorite channels, but was horrified to find that it suddenly was telling me that a subscription was required. I thought this was an error and went to another one of my channels, but got the same message. TBS, TNT, TLC, OWN, FX, MTV, Freeform, Disney, Cartoon Network, Nick, and more, all gone. I went online to the xfinity website to run a diagnosis and system reset, but I was still being greeted by the same ""subscription required"" messages when the TV came back on. I spoke to a technical support rep on the phone, who took a look at my account and informed me that the missing channels should be included based on my subscription, told me that multiple customers in my area were also experiencing the same issue, apologised for the inconvenience, ensured me that she would do every thing to help me get my channels back, and scheduled a technician to take a closer look at the situation and check my cable box in case it needed to be updated. 

The next day the technician shows up and informs me that there is nothing wrong with my box and that the channels are not included in my package. I informed him that can't be possible because I've never changed my cable package for as long as I've been an xfinity customer, and also that the technical support rep told me I was supposed to have those channels. I called technical support again in front of the technician, but this time I was getting a completely different story. This 2nd rep told me he had no idea where the 1st got her info from, but that what had actually happened is that Comcast changed their line up at the beginning of March, and that all my channels were now only part of the Digital Starter package, which is the next package up, and that I would have to upgrade to get these channels. I told him that can't be right because I've had these channels for as long as I've had comcast and it doesnt make sense they are suddenly part of a different package, especially since I was just watching these channels in the 3rd week of March. Then he said that with the package I had before, these were all just ""bonus"" channels that were given to customers with the Digital Economy package for free, and was never meant to be a part of the lineup for that package. 

Now this all sounds like a load of crap and just a massive screw up on Comcasts part. Aside from upgrading or removing the internet from my package, the only change I've ever made to my actual cable subscription is adding Epix to my lineup. I have been a ""valued"" customer for over 3 years, not even counting the years that my family has used comcast under a different account name, and we've always had the same cable package, with the same channels that I suddenly need an upgrade for. About 8 months ago I dropped the internet from our package because our bill was getting too expensive. The only reason I didn't downgrade the cable was because those channels were not included in the limited package, and were only listed as part of my current package and higher. Now some guy on the phone is telling me those channels were never a part of the lineup even though i distinctly recall looking at the website at the time and seeing those channels listed as part of the lineup for the Digital Economy package??? He is telling me that these were just bonus channels, but certainly these bonus channels would have been listed as a temporary promotion SOMEWHERE if that were the case, and that must also mean that I've had these free bonus channels for over 3 years and counting and no one said or did anything about it??? 

After a bit of arguing and a whole bunch of useless apologies from the 2nd technical support rep, he decided to pass me off to a customer solutions rep who proved to be even more useless than he was. Instead of giving me any actual solutions to my problem, this new guy told me that the only thing I could do was upgrade to the Digital Starter package. I told him that I did not want to upgrade to anything or pay any more money just to gain access to channels I've already had access to for *YEARS* up until this past week. My current bill ranges from anywhere between $99-$105 month to month with this current package, even though just 8 months ago my bill was under $80 after i dropped the internet and added Epix. Mr. Customer solutions thought it would be such a good idea for me to just upgrade to Starter and I would ""*only* pay about $120 per month"" for all the channels I wanted. $120 IS HOW MUCH MY BILL WAS LAST YEAR WHEN I DOWNGRADED MY PACKAGE *BECAUSE* IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE. I WOULD BE PAYING THAT SAME AMOUNT TO UPGRADE NOW, AND I WOULDN'T EVEN GET INTERNET OR HOTSPOTS INCLUDED LIKE I DID BACK THEN! As I've already mentioned multiple times before, ALL JUST SO I CAN HAVE ACCESS TO CHANNELS THAT I'VE ALREADY HAD ACCESS TO AND HAVE BEEN WATCHING FOR YEARS???! With this current lineup, now there's only about 5 channels that I watch, ( I'm not including all the local channels that I would still have access to anyways WITHOUT paying for cable) yet I'm paying about $100 monthly for that, and it was already too pricy even with the ""extra"" channels. I told him that I refused to upgrade and pay more for channels I've already had, but if he wanted to upgrade my account and keep my bill the same, I would gladly work with him there. He told me that was not possible and I could either pay more with an upgrade to watch my channels, or deal with the channels I had now.

I asked Mr. Customer Solutions to let me speak to a supervisor or a manager, but he informed me that they were all in a meeting, and I could only leave a message. How convenient. He then tells me that they wouldn't be able to do anything anyways, and continues his attempts to persuade me into upgrading my services. I chose to leave the voicemail anyways and left a very long worded message.

The most baffling thing about this entire situation is that two technical support agents for the same company gave me entirely different explanations for my problem, and the customer solutions agent's ""solution"" felt much closer to an ultimatum, because I can either pay more money to get my channels back, or continue to pay what's already an absurd price, but without the channels I've had and cherished for years. ( Yes I said it again for the millionth time. I will NEVER let this go) The next equally baffling thing is that they would make such a change with absolutley no warning. Not a call, not an email, not any physical mail. I feel like I had a rug pulled right from under me. I looked online to see if I could find any complaints, and the only results I found were complaints about changes made in January of LAST year. Rather than inform me before the new year that I was going to lose all my favorite channels unless I upgraded and paid more for a package that was essentially exactly the same as what I currently had, I had to discover that for myself and sit in confusion as I waste time trying to figure out what the heck was happening and why. 

Obviosuly speaking to these reps helped me in absolutely no way. All they provided me with were empty apologies with no reparations, and a whole lot of frustration. I remember the good old days when calling Comcast support with a complaint often resulted in being offered a better package deal at a lower price. And this was as recent as a little over a year ago. I've stuck with comcast all this time because I love their simple, clean layout and television functions/features, especially with xfinity on demand. I've rarely ever had any issues with them for as long as I've been a customer, and when I did, they were subsequently taken care of with ease. This issue, however, is highly unnaceptable and enough to make me want to drop them altogether. Comcast, you need to get your shit together.

I gave them device names from DNS, IPs, traceroutes to/from the affected host and my home, time stamps, graphs that plot the packet-loss, etc. However, i cannot get out of tier 1 hell and the person from the executive complaints team sounded like she had her soul sucked out and was just a shell of her former self and couldnt be bothered to show any concern or caring.

"Call rep cannot locate offer listed on xfinity websiteHello,

I went to sign up as a new customer today for internet service and the website for my address listed 29.99 internet for 12 months. However when I call to sign up for this deal, the call rep was very confused because she said that intro deal ended on 3/21 and she does not even see it on her screen. She kept asking if I maybe already had it in my cart from weeks earlier and that’s why it was showing the deal still. I did not, I just added it to my cart before calling.

I removed it from my cart, cleared my browser history/cookies and sure enough the deal is there again. When trying to purchase it I get all the way to the final screen before it says that there is an issue and I need to call. The rep after trying to troubleshoot for a long time and having me send screen shots to her of the 29.99 offer on my screen said she could put me in a higher cost plan for right now to get service and then submit a ticket to have it looked into and later downgraded to the 29.99 plan. I should hear back within 24-48 hours.

What is the deal here? My gut tells me I shouldn’t be confident they will honor the deal despite it still showing as of right now for the the $29.99 price. How can she not see it in her system when plain as day if you put in my address on the website as a new customer it is one of the first plans to show up? I’m just very confused at why what should be a very simple procedure turned into a 45 minute phone call where the resolution still hasn’t come. It doesn’t leave a good initial impression of Xfinity with me. If I can prove I am seeing the $29.99 rate, I feel like the call rep should be able to honor that rate without having to submit a ticket that will take another 1-2 business days to resolve.

"Anyone ever use the public ""xfinitywifi"" hotspot instead of home WiFi to save data??So these scam artist data caps have been hitting me pretty hard the last few months. 1tb is nothing with a 300Mbps/down connection with a family of 5 constantly streaming data. We average around 1.2 Tb per month whitch equals to around $40 a month extra. Not enough to spend the extra $10 for unlimited but over what I'd like. From what I understand is that your modem gives off a sort of public hotspot for guests to use so they don't have access to your internal network, and data used on that hotspot doesn't count toward your cap.

"Connectivity problem between some Comcast home networksI can reach my home network (Comcast) from anywhere I've tried, except for two friend's homes. (Both Comcast)

The two problematic locations are using different Comcast gateways.  The one that I have been able to test from has a new xFi Advanced Gateway with default settings.

This is what I've been able to test so far (all testing done by verified IP addresses, so DNS is not an issue.):

* From the problematic location, I cannot ping any of 3 different friend's Comcast routers.
* From the problematic location, traceroute to any of the 3 friends dies after the first hop. (LAN IP of the gateway. [10.0.0.1](https://10.0.0.1))  
* All 3 friends can ping each other.
* None of them can ping the problematic location. (ICMP reply is probably disabled.)
* Traceroute from any of the 3 friends to the problematic location all die after several hops, and at the same hop. (Likely the last hop before the problematic router.)

My guess is that the problematic router is dropping the outgoing traffic to the other 3 locations for some reason.  No traffic gets through... not just ping and traceroute.  I've tried accessing multiple services using custom and standard ports.  Nothing works.

All other Internet traffic seems fine.  

Why would the router be blocking access to other Comcast customer IP addresses?

"How do I get simultaneous Commercial Internet & Residential TV to the same residential address?So after years of keeping my eyes peeled I found a job as a full time telecommuter in my field. Yay!

I called Comcast today to inquire about the process of upgrading my home internet to a Business/Commercial account in order to get that prioritized traffic & (more importantly) that 4 hour SLA. My job requires I be on-call often, 24/7, and they are willing to pay for business home internet. I have a quote for turning this service on, fairly straight forward. They mention apologetically as an aside that they CANNOT offer Commercial TV to residential addresses, but ... that's fine with me, I don't want or need that.

But then I asked what this would do to my Residential cable TV account bill, because on their ""packaging system"" I know on the residential side it will appear as though I'm downgrading my service instead of upgrading it. Sure enough, first residential rep tells me I will now be paying the same amount/month, for JUST cable TV instead of TV + Internet. Despite the fact that I'm also now going to be paying them $200-$250/mo for business internet. First rep understands that this is kinda fubar, so they transfer me to a loyalty rep who can figure out how to attach special discounts not available to the first guy.

Well I get transferred around a bit before I land at a Residential Loyalty Rep, and she immediately proceeds to tell me that the conversation about my Residential cable TV pricing is moot, because none of their TV boxes work now without having Internet first, and if I don't have a **residential** internet account with them, none of the TV boxes will work. Even if I have a separate business account. They have no way to join these two accounts. 

I had to laugh. I effectively had a Comcast Customer Loyalty Rep telling me that in my quest to spend a small fortune on Internet with them, I would be de facto forcing myself to cut the cord & no longer even be ABLE to get cable TV services from them.

What a stupid fucking company.

"Sent to debt collection for not returning a cable box that I never had.This began around 2014/2015. At that time I had only Internet service from Comcast and I used my own modem & router. I was pretty good about fending off their weekly spam calls to ""upgrade"" my service (read: buy more products). But they got me one time. It was the bait and switch. The line was something like ""would like faster internet speed at no cost to you"" and of course, I stupidly said yes, I would like that. Well at the very end of the call it became clear that the faster speed was part of a package that included television service (and I assume a large rate increase after the ""promotional period"" ended). After cursing myself out for a few minutes, I called Comcast back and explained that I changed my mind, I don't want faster Internet and I definitely don't want TV service from them. The End. Or so I thought.



Fast forward some months later, I move from that residence to another state where I am beholden to Time Warner instead of Comcast, so I terminate my Comcast service and move on with my life. Fast forward another month or so and I get a final bill from Comcast that includes a fee for an un-returned cable box. I call them and explain that I never had cable service with them, and that I never had a cable box. They seemed to think that they shipped me one anyway. I refused to pay and we agreed to disagree.



So now for the past couple years I've been getting voicemails once or twice a week from a debt collection agency. I now have the number blocked, so my phone doesn't actually ring. Thanks Comcast.",Comcast

"Have to reset modem to keep speedHey all,

I just switched to gigabit speed about a month ago, but the last 3 days ive been having an issue where my speed will go from averaging like 960 on a speed test, to 5-25. when i reset my modem it then starts working again until about a day later when i have to reset it again. does anyone know what could cause an issue like this? 

Im using an Arris SB8200 and a nighthawk AC1600. i have no problem with speeds after resets, im just so confused on why it keeps dropping to below the lowest packages speeds until i do. 

could it be the modem, something on comcasts end, or maybe my wiring? im not sure where to check to start to find out

"Free TG1682G from Comcast, worth using?I've always bought my own modem and separate router, but just moved and Comcast is part of our HOA services, and they delivered a TG1682G plus about 150/10mbs (having a hard time finding out what it is supposed to be, but it tests about there or a bit more down).  

&#x200B;

I have been busy moving and did not take time to swap it out for my own (I usually run a DD-WRT variant). I have been pleasantly surprised that it has been rock stable both in terms of wired and wireless performance.

&#x200B;

About the only thing so far I'm missing with DD-WRT that I use is dnsmasq (which I could put on linux and frankly probably work better as the dd-wrt implementation is a bit flakey) and OpenVPN (which I very rarely use, but could probably pass through to linux somehow) and some internal routing (which I can do on the layer 2+ switch I have). 

&#x200B;

I planned to get rid of it, never have trusted their own equipment and never wanted to pay for it.  But it's free (or more precisely whatever I am paying I will be paying regardless).  And it seems solid.

&#x200B;

Any good reason not to use it?

&#x200B;

Do they keep it reasonably patched from a security standpoint?

&#x200B;

Or maybe switch to bridge mode and use it for modem and another for routing so I can run dd-wrt?

"Absolutely Horrible Customer ServiceSo my family has had Comcast for over ten years now. We’ve always had issues with their service, be it overcharging, ridiculous download limits, confusing service reps, etc. 

On Friday (3/01) my dad called to change his wifi plan. Yesterday we received a router in the mail that we didn’t order from them. He explained explicitly to the rep that he didn’t require any hardware from them. My dad calls customer service (because our internet has been down for hours today) and, after spending thirty minutes trying to get through the automated customer service bot, he gets through to a representative. They inform him that the rep he originally called to change his plan had A) charged him more than they told my dad they would be charging him, B) sent him a router with less capability than he was promised with his plan, and C) scheduled a maintenance appointment with a technician that we did not ask for. 

That original representative told my father that he had been getting charged for going over his bandwidth limit every month for the past year. Due to previous complications with this exact issue at our old house, my dad has been watching the bill to check for overage charges and this was a blatant lie. We don’t have a data limit at all. He also told my dad he was getting charged $50 for every additional 10gb of data used, when in reality the charge in our area is supposed to be $10 for 50gb for customers that have data caps.

My dad is hypothesizing that they shut off our internet in anticipation for us setting up with their proprietary router (we currently use a Netgear modem). None of the representatives he’s contacted has denied that so far. 

This is some real bullshit.

"How to get Comcast to honor their word?Hi All,

TLDR: Comcast refuses to honor package they sold me, and won't revert my service back without me paying extra. 

I'm seeking advise on how to remedy the situation I'm currently in with Comcast customer support. Here is the story:

Here was my plan before the call: Basic cable (without HD service) so roughly 25 channels, HBO and 150 mbps internet for $110/month (including taxes). This information is for reference.

On Tuesday 2/12 I received a call from Comcast about new bundle packages they were offering. The plan that the sales person was pitching was 220+ HD channels with showtime, stars and a Netflix subscription, and also 150 mbps internet for $125/month plus tax. Since I am already a Netflix subscriber, I was willing do entertain this package as it would only cost me an extra $5-10/month after taxes. 

I asked enquired about the Netflix package and was assured that it was the 4k plan with 4 devices streaming at a time. I was reassured by the sales rep that if I wasn't satisfied within the first 30 days I could call back and revert back to my old plan. It all sounded good so I approved the change. I was told by the rep that I would need to restart my cable box and that I would be receiving an email with the new Netflix login shortly after everything goes into effect. 

On Thursday 2/21 my wife asked me if I ever received the Netflix login, which I had not. This prompted me to call customer support. Once on the line I was told that the package that I was expecting was the next tier up from where I upgraded to. They offered to grant me 6 months of either stars or showtime for free, but could not offer Netflix because ""we have to pay that money to Netflix."" I said that misunderstandings happen and I would like to revert back to my previous plan. I was told they no longer offer that plan, and would have to choose a new lower plan, with slower internet for the price I was paying before. I stated that I was only interested in that if my internet speed stayed at 150 mbps to which I was told was an additional $15/month. I asked if they could waive this fee like they can do for the premium channels, and was told no. At this point I asked to speak with a supervisor. Cue supervisor. 

In a nutshell the conversation went the same with the supervisor, he spent much of the time pitching the ""value"" that the higher plans bring with their additional channels, and the ""valve"" of 6 months of a free premium channel. I stated that I watch very little TV, the internet speed is what I value. The conversation came to a halt when I said that because I picked up the phone and agreed to take the offer, my options are to either:

1: Not get what they were offering on the sales call, and pay an additional $27/month for additional channels that I don't care about. 

or 

2: Drop down to a comparable plan to what I had before, pay for the additional internet add-on to keep my previous internet speed, and pay an additional $15/month.

At this point the supervisor said he would pull the recorded sales call, review it and call me back with further options. I accepted this proposal and the call ended.

The next day (Friday) my wife received a call from the supervisor saying he would need another day to review the call, and would reach out to us on Saturday 2/23. We never received a call Saturday, but got an email stating we had a $120 credit on our account. Cue today

I called customer support to ask what this credit on my account is and was told that it would be applied if I upgraded to the next tier account. I confirmed that what they were offering me was a ""free"" 6 months at the next tier, at which point I would have to pay the $150+ amount for that package. The rep confirmed, and I said I'm not ready to make that decision now, and ended the call. 

Through all of these calls I was repeatedly told that ""we can only apply packages and discounts that are in the system"" and ""we can't do anything else for you."" 

Does anyone here have any advise experience in contacting someone at Comcast that can actually make changes on accounts to honor what their sales people pitch? Any help here is greatly appreciated. ",Comcast
"Can Comcast double bill me for both business and residential on the same line during the same period of service?Last month my roommate and I moved to a new, smaller apartment unit when our third roommate moved out. We had a business plan for the 3 of us and I transferred that to the new unit, but then about a week or two later canceled that service (within the 30 day money back guarantee period) and began residential service at that address. This transfer was on January 25th and the change to residential was on February 5th.

When the bill for the first month of the business service came in, I paid the installation/transfer fee without complaint as that was disclosed up-front as being non-refundable. There was one month's charge for service on the bill, which didn't entirely surprise me as I figured that bill may have been pre-generated and the amount might be refunded the following month. I paid both by the due date to make sure nothing became delinquent, and then called in (which was a pain in the ass to say the least) to find out what was going on. The guy I talked to said the money back guarantee would be honored, a check would be cut to me for the refundable amount, gave me a date to expect the check to be sent, and gave me a ticket number.

This week I've received a bill for a second month of business service. I thought maybe this was the refund being documented, but it's a charge for another month's worth of service. I opened a chat support with a guy who was useless and just advised me to call the 800 number and speak with Retention. He said my service was not disconnected on February 5th, but that it takes 60 days to fully disconnect service. Before calling I wanted to do some digging, see what other information I could gather, post here, etc.

The disconnect request documentation does state that the request serves as a 60 day notice. However, service was clearly disconnected on the 5th when the residential service took over. Business chat support has confirmed for me that they don't see my modem on the account; they state I still have service but just don't have a modem connected right now. Other questions I asked went nowhere (have there been any changes to the account? when did the modem go offline? do I have an IPv4 or IPv6 address lease? etc.).

This is only for about $70 and I feel like if I bark up the tree long enough I can get it refunded, but to me they are double dipping by trying to charge me for both residential and business services on the same cable line. It's not a huge amount of money, but I think it's unethical, assuming it's legal, for them to play the billing game this way.

On the subject of ethics, the 30 day money-back guarantee **is** disclosed on the original transfer contract, but the 60 day required notice for termination is **not**; the first documentation I can find with that on it is the request itself, so that definitely feels like a gotcha.

"Repeat Disconnects at Set Time / Looking for Additional Thoughts [Support / Long Text]First, I apologies now, this is very long.

&#x200B;

So, about 6 months ago, at 6.38pm each night, I would get booted from  the online game I was playing. At first, I blamed the game. Then the wife was playing the same game, at 6.38pm, both of our games  got booted. Weird we thought, maybe there server is having issues?

&#x200B;

A little while longer, I was playing a different online game, 6.38pm, I got booted. OK, so it was not the original game server. I started running a ping trace, and every-time it failed, it would write a time/date stamp. {I'm also copying these into an excel spreadsheet, just in case someone, even a Comcast tech, gives me an email to send this off too}

&#x200B;

It became regular, so I figured I'd reach out to Comcast, a tech came  out, wasn't able to be at the property at the time it happens, so said  he'd monitor it, as nothing appeared wrong with the cabling, but he did  manage to switch out the X1 boxes, as they were old? Anyways. He told me text him if it didn't get resolved, first text, I got the  reply he was still seeing issues on the line and they'll fix it, next  text, no reply.

&#x200B;

So, I called again, got another tech out, he went through most of the  same stuff, although, he states the splitter was old, and one of my  wires under the crawl space was spliced and needed replacing and even though the first tech (up above) said he was unable to do it due to  regulations, this guy went along and replaced all the wiring, hoping it  was the fault. He couldn't be around for the time, so I let him know it  didn't work. \[as this guy promised me he'd text me back, which he did\]

&#x200B;

So, he figured it could be a few things, and to avoid at the moment  me spending any money, he opted to look/replace the Comcast stuff. So,  The gateway got replaced, different brand, nope didn't fix it. He  suggested it could be the wire that runs from the cable to the outside  of the home (I think he called it the drop cable) he replaced that.  Still going on. So he spoke to a fellow tech, who like I thought they  may do at some point,  blamed my hardware.

&#x200B;

Now, I did think it was my Netgear router, and I posted stuff in  forums way before I reached to Comcast, my router didn't have a a  scheduled reboot and I even went to the extent of re-flashing a custom  firmware in case it was my firmware that was corrupted. Even with that,  it still did that. Now, to appease the 'router question' I went out and bought a brand  new router (same make and model) and installed it, it still did it, it  still lost connection at a fixed time \[give or take a minute or two\]

&#x200B;

So, the next suggestions was to put take the router out of bridge  mode (as I have my own router), which I wasn't too happy with, as I  don't like cross networking, having 10.x.x.x and 192.x.x.x on the same  network (and I wasn't changing my IP's to match). I did notice though I  was having issues getting to some pages, probably cross networking. But,  anyways, that didn't help either. I was still getting disconnects.

&#x200B;

All this time the lights stay the same on the gateway.

&#x200B;

The second tech was still helping and thinking about other things and  coming back to me via text message. But I'm looking for other suggestions, to maybe tell him. An IT buddy of mine mentioned it may be  the gateway heartbeat for the wireless that is offered to Xfinity customer, so I asked the tech if he had a docsis3.0 normal modem to take  that out the equation, but he doesn't. I don't want to be spending more money on a modem with phone support, just to take the gateway out the equation. 

&#x200B;

So, I've got a brand new wiring, brand new gateway, brand new router  (no custom setting within the router) and yet I'm getting disconnects,  the 18.38 one can vary by a minute or too, but the 7.30am happens at  7.30am every morning.

&#x200B;

To put the icing on the cake, I'm a content creator and stream, so I  don't need to be online and lose connection through no fault of my own.

&#x200B;

Now it appears this next tech is also dropping of the face of the earth, I've not heard from him in two weeks and the text I sent 2 days ago hasn't been replied too.

&#x200B;

Thoughts? Any things I can try, maybe someone who's good with  networks/scripting knows a way I can trace-route, maybe find a failure  point? I'm 99.99999% sure it's not my equipment, or only my PC would have it happening, etc

"Intermittent packet lossI've been having this issue for months and now the weather is getting colder again (30-40F), the issue seems to be more frequent again (we had a rise in temperature from 60-75F maybe a week or so ago). I had a tech come out and figure out that the lines outside were cracking and they needed to found and corrected (this was back in 1/25/2019) but I can't figure out if it was ever corrected (not entirely at least). Tried contacting support, one person tells me there are issues in the area that are being fixed and I asked someone again today about this issue and they tell me there was no issues in the area.

I've already scheduled another tech to come out to do the same thing as the guy did back in the January. The funny thing is..all the signals look fine and I can browse the web and watch videos (like on YT or Twitch) without much issue..but when I play games or try to stream, it's not stable at all. When I'm in discord, I can see my packet loss occurring as the signal indication dips into yellow and red intermittently when I'm in the server and then back to green (I'm getting cut out when I'm talking to people).

This has only been running for a few minutes now, but every time there is packet loss, my ping jumps up to 111+ (yellow indication) and now I'm either losing stream connection or my character in-game is teleporting back and forth. I've also had some random cutouts where I have to restart my modem to my connection back. I think my upstream is also taking a pretty major hit, but all the signal levels are fine.

Edit: I know the issue was only reported back in January, but you would not notice it unless you were playing a game or streaming. Once you run a pingplotter, you start to notice packet loss ever 1-4 minutes. Back in January, it was almost ever 1-2 minutes I would get a red line indicating packet loss and ping spikes.

"Life 11 months after cancelling my Comcast account.This is copy pasted from [Facebook](https://bit.ly/2NdDt0X):

I posted this to the Xfinity page, but it doesn't appear that they allow for public posts (imagine that). Here we go with the proper hastags. #xfinity #comcast #comcastic

Up until 11 months ago, I had been a Comcast customer most of my adult life. My parents had Comcast when I lived at home, my roommates and I had Comcast while I was in college, and my wife and I had Comcast all 3 places we've lived since we got married nearly 10 years ago.

Up until that point, my only real problem with Comcast had been the introductory rate trick they use to gouge customers after they've been signed up for a few months. It’s a shady business practice IMHO, but Comcast is hardly the only company out there doing that to their customers.

11 months ago, I cancelled my Comcast account. I did this specifically because monthly data caps had been applied to my account with no communication from your company that this was happening. I only found out AFTER I had already gone over the monthly allowance AND used both of my freebie months for doing so.

When I went to cancel, I was told that an email HAD been sent out announcing this. Since I don't delete emails, I was able to go back through every communication from your company to me and saw that, in fact, I was being lied to. There was never any communication sent out.

In the 11 months since I cancelled my account with Comcast, I have dealt with the following:

1. Numerous calls harassing me to return equipment that I had already returned directly to a Comcast store.

2. New equipment being sent to my house 8 months after I cancelled the account. When I called to let you guys know that I would be happy to slap a shipping label on the box to return it to you, I was told I would be charged for the equipment if I didn't physically deliver said equipment to a Comcast or UPS store. It took 45 mins of arguing over the phone to get you guys to agree that the shipment wasn't my fault and returning the equipment wasn't my responsibility.

3. Getting sent to collections 11 months after cancellation for an amount I never got billed for (which turned out to be some portion of my final bill). There were no follow-up bills/emails/calls, just straight to collections. This was also never mentioned by any of the numerous associates I talked to on the phone. When I log on to my account online, I didn't have any means by which to pay the bill since I no longer had an account with you guys... I had to call you, yet again. On principal I wanted to fight this charge, but I'm just too tired. You can have your final $48.68.

Feel free to fact check any of this information. I know you recorded all of these conversations, so you should have full access to all this information.

Now what am I expecting Comcast to do to make this right? Nothing. Why would I expect ANYTHING from Comcast after all of this?

So why am I writing this? Easy: I've been told that the only way to have my complaints heard by your company is to air my dirty laundry on social media in front of the world. I hate that this is my only recourse against what would traditionally be categorized by almost anybody as ""shameful business practices.""

You win. You're system is so broken that I have to resort to this. I hate it. It's teaching our youth that screaming in a public forum is the only way to get anything done. It's setting a bad precedent for America.

I know you guys do a lot of work to maintain your social media, so I’m sure this will get deleted. Shame on you regardless.

Please stop harassing me.

I will happily release full transcripts of my interactions with them once this issue is closed/resolved, for transparency's sake.  I don't want to do that now as they haven't formally said ""No"" to my request for a public apology.  

If they made me complain in a public forum to get anything done, I expect them to do so as well.",Comcast

"Getting Rid of ComcastHi Reddit,

&#x200B;

I've always been the type of person to never set up automatic payment so I can keep better track of my personal finances. After finally giving in due to a few late payments, I decided to check my costs at the end of the year. I think the original rate I was paying was somewhere around $100 for internet and cable.

I went to the local store and after waiting in line for 40 minutes was told that I can't drop the box off and the rep over the phone didn't know what she was talking about. I didn't want to press the issue too much because Comcast has a terrible reputation for lying and misleading. All I use is internet for streaming/gaming(league of legends). My sig. other only watches 3 channels(lifetime, history, bravo, cnn). Is something like Sling TV worth it? I see $25 + $5 for all the channels I would need but I don't know if they have all the BS charges like Comcast. As for internet I see AT&T offers DSL for  ""Speeds up to 100 Mbps."" for $40.

That being said, I pay for 150 Mbps, which 
is ~16 MBps (1 Mb = 0.125 MB) 

So my 1 TB would theoretically take 65,536 seconds to download

65,536 seconds 
1092.267 minutes 
18.204 hours

I know this probably doesn’t equate straight across like I am presenting it, but Comcast is basically saying: 

“Yup, go ahead and use your 150 Mbps! You’ll love it! Just know that you’ve only got 18 hours at that speed before you hit your data limit!” 

Comcast can take their 1 TB and shove it where the sun don’t shine because that is an absolute load of shit. 

Oh by the way, it is possible to use over 1 TB because I’ve been charged $160 in additional charges which equates to 800 GB of additional data. 


EDIT: 
To add to that time comparison, if I used my internet for a 1/4 of the total time in a month, I would have to limit myself to 1/16 of my bandwidth to not go over ",Comcast

"Comcast raised my bill twice in two months.Was paying 70 dollars for 150mb/s
My contract ended (second time I've had one) and it went to 88 dollars. I was upset when I called and they wouldn't do another deal with me, but I thought 18 dollars wasn't the end of the world.

Get my bill again today, and it's now 104 dollars. Called and they just told me to basically eat dirt. Won't sign another contract with me, and they told me they upped me to 250mb/s. Well, I don't get that (only around 170, which I also got with my 150) I then told them to move me back down to 150 and I was only getting 60.

Had to call back and get myself back on 250 to get what I was getting at 150.

"Charged $500+ due to Comcast’s errorMight be a long post. So I moved back in August and immediately upon moving in I plugged in my box and router and called Comcast to transfer my service to my new address. No problem. Within minutes of the phone call, my tv and internet are working great.

Fast forward 5 months and I notice an issue with my bill on the my account app. I only noticed because my service had been disabled so I looked at my bill. The amount resembled what I have been paying for 2 years which is why I didn’t notice that the address was somewhere halfway across the country and my name was different (ie not me). I called and after the Comcast ringer I discovered that my old account had never been cancelled and my current addresses account had gone delinquent for 5 months of non payment. 

I work in customer service and I understand the script these people have to go through all day so I was patient and on the phone for two hours. Finally the right representative was able to get my old address finally disconnected (the tenants who moved into my old apartment had still been using my service on my dime) and taken off my bill and I was assured all was good. 

Not good. A few weeks later my app hasn’t updated with my current address so I call back and 1 hour later I get connected with the right guy who is able to fix my account app so I can accurately see my bill. To my very pissed surprise my account states that I am $550 ish past due. Two more hours later I am assured that all of my payments on my previous address will be transferred over to my current account and all will be hunky dory after some department reviews my case.

Fast forward to today. My service has been suspended due to non payment. I call. Again. They state that the correct department is closed. No problem. Hang up. Call back. Insist that their must be someone who can help me. Sort of. Turns out that department that had to review my account said that the money taken from my bank to pay each bill had already been applied to my old account and cannot be transferred. 

So no I have a 1 day extension so I can call tomorrow and hope that my problems will finally be fixed.

TLDR: Comcast didn’t cancel my old addresses account soo continued to pay for it while my current addresses account went delinquent for non payment. Now I owed $500+.",Comcast

"Should I sign up for XFi Advantage for the included unlimited internet?I have my own router and modem and have just used the second complimentary month of overage (data cap of 1TB, co-op house with 12 people who all stream netflix, $10 per 50GB of overage, we used 1700GB last month. Essentially, unlimited data is required). I called about the $25 unlimited data promo, but they said that it has been replaced by the XFi modem/router rental for $15 a month which includes unlimited data. Without the promo, unlimited data is $50 a month.

Is there any reason not to get their modem? They said on the phone that I can put it in bridge mode (which would turn off the wifi hotspot and everything else) and use my own router. As far as I can tell I could get unlimited for $15 instead of $50 this way and nobody in the house would know the difference.

I personally see no reason not to do it, but I don't want to get blindsided by something.

It'll be the XB3 router/modem from the calls I've made. That should suffice for 150mbps down.

Edit: I forgot that I can't upgrade my service to promo rates because I am already a customer.... so going from 150mbps to 250mbps would mean going to non-promo rates which is essentially not worth it.

"Free internet on accidentSo this is kind of a long story. We recently built a house and moved in about 3 months ago. I had Comcast go by the house and make sure it was serviceable about a week before we moved in. They said it was. The day after we move in they come by to install the service. Two techs came out and said it would not be possible and that I would have to get construction out here to run the lines first. I was upset obviously because they told me the week prior that it was serviceable. The problem was that our house is about 400 feet off the road where the cable is. So then started the saga of contacting Comcast to try to get someone out here to estimate the cost of running the lines. I couldn't get any movement from residential and was told to contact Comcast business. This did get things moving faster but when we got the estimate after about 2 weeks we were floored. They said the cost would be $20,000!! Yes you read that right. Anyhow, the reason (they claimed) was because their cabling at the road was at its limit and they would have to put in a new node, power supply, tap, and half inch hard line up to our new house. They said they would cover some of the cost but never could give me an answer as to how much. So at this point we were obviously trying to come up with other ideas. I called a friend of mine who used to work for Comcast. He said he wasn't surprised with the situation and the cost but didn't think it was necessary. To be sure he came by and measured the tap at the road and said it was red hot. So he said to get some RG 11 w/ messenger and he'll run the line and use an amp if necessary. I paid about $300 for a 1000ft spool. Contrast that with Comcast's claim that the cable itself was going to cost me $10,000 alone. So he comes out a few days later and hooks it up. The run ended up being just under 500 feet so we were expecting the signal to be quite degraded at the house. To our surprise, the signal was still good at around 0 to -2 dBmV.  So now the trick was to call Comcast and get them to activate the service. I had my own modem from my previous address so I just needed to call and get them to activate it. I spent probably 6 hours talking to different reps until I finally was able to get someone to activate the modem without sending a tech out first. They kept saying a tech needed to come out to see if it was serviceable since it was a new construction, but we obviously were trying to avoid that. Since they could see the modem was up and had power someone finally agreed to send it a signal and it activated. They emailed me a contract which I signed and I have a static public IP. The thing is, my address is still listed as unserviceable when I look it up online, and when I bring up my account online it says I don't have service. But I do have service and have for almost 3 months. My name and address are correct on my account online as well. At this point I'm not sure what to do, getting free internet is great but don't know how long it will last and can see trouble in the wind. We have to have high speed internet because my wife works mostly from home. Anyone have any ideas as to what may have happened? Or what I should say if I call in and say I'm not getting a bill?

Later that day I call back. Another agent picks up and we repeat conversation. They say that they can help and that their supervisor will call me back to help me with this case and to call collections to have this charge removed. Once again no calls received from them since.

"Gig speed and personal modem = mystery to Comcast employeesFacts: 
I am a Double Play customer with TV and Gig Speed service using a Netgear Nighthawk CM1100 modem. I bought this modem on day 2 of having Gig Speed. The modem is approved by most internet providers, including Comcast. 

So here’s the thing, providing tv and internet service must be hard. It must be as difficult as operating on a fetal heart. Well, that’s the idea I’m getting based on the past 3 weeks of dealing with Comcast folks on the phone, via Twitter, via Forums, and in person at an Xfinity store. 

This all started when my monthly rate jumped $65. I called Comcast on January 21 to try and get a new promotion. You know, the song and dance...

The person on the other end wasn’t able to do anything for me in terms of making changes because they said I couldn’t have Gig speed internet without renting their modem. I asked if they knew, or could see, that I was running my own modem and even went as far as explaining a technician came to my house about a week into my service, thanks to ComcastElla of the company forums, and adjusted a few things so I’d get the consistent performance a Gig Speed customer would expect. I asked for a supervisor who was able to find me a promotional rate for Double Play Latin. I’m not Latin. I was surprised. He said not to worry. It’s just random where promotions come up. Go figure. When he tried to apply that promotion, he couldn’t. He said my personal modem on the account was causing an error to show up. After 85 minutes, I thanked them, rudely, for their time. 

January 23, I figured I’d go to the local store and speak with a human being in person. The rep I had (who hasn’t answered emails I’ve sent recently) did a good job of getting me a plan that was about $10 higher than I was paying. Considering the mental torture I had a few days prior, I took it. She said there’d be a $70 charge for the Gig Speed, even though I had it. She said her manager would remove it. I trusted them.

A week later, I noticed that the $70 wasn’t removed, so I called Xfinity. The person I talked to made me feel confident they’d remove the $70 charge. The next day, I had 2 more $70 charges. Insane!

This is when I took to Twitter, first plug locks, then via DM. Usually, going the Twitter route is better, but it’s been almost 10 days or so of ZERO progress being made. 

The gist: I must be the only person who uses their own modem, or the CM1100, specifically. Nobody at Comcast can figure out how to get the error they receive when trying to do ANYTHING on my account. I’ve asked for SOMETHING for my troubles and frustration, like a premium channel or two. Guess what? They can’t do it because they get errors. I had a local customer care rep call me last Sunday who said “they’re working on it” and then she called back on Thursday night, this time asking me to drop down to 350 megabit per second service. I told her no way because I get Gig Speed service as it is already. She said she’d file a ticket with the “highest group” responsible for that sort of thing. I asked why she or anyone else hasn’t done this sooner. She didn’t have an answer. I’ve tweeted a few more times to check in, and based on the random agent who answers, I still get the generic answer of “keep waiting”, more or less. 

I’ve even helped them think outside their own mental box. I suggested they try to build me a new account, from scratch. I don’t think anyone I’ve suggested this to has the aptitude to understand what I’m suggesting. Sad. Very sad. 

Who else can I deal with there? How hard can this be?

* I check my account and nothing is stated as outstanding.

* My mailing address was a separate one from the apartment, and i received all bills there. Since the final bill, I've received nothing.

* I answer the automated call and talk to a guy who is obviously in or from another country, and explained the above.

* He informs me everything is just fine and I stop getting calls.

** *

Calls then stop for a few months but then resume

* I have since been getting constantly spammed everyday with these calls
* It's been 7 months since I cancelld and I still see nothing in the mail or otherwise stating I owe anything.
* Nothing on my credit has been affected

** *

So is this a scam? 

Otherwise what the hell is happening, and how do I make it stop?

"Seven months later and no refundI had an account that was overcharged before it closed in August 2018. They owed me $65.90, no big deal right? I returned the equipment but for some reason this never reached their records.

I have gone through so many customer service representatives who have all told me that ""my account was notated with the mistake"" and that I'd receive the check soon. I've had multiple service tickets and every time I check on them I'm told that they were automatically closed because of the unreturned equipment. I was getting incessant phone calls from their debt collectors until I finally solved it on that end but they just won't send me my god damn check.

I've been at this for seven months. I've been flat out lied to and told most recently that the check was processed on January 15th and would arrive in 7-10 business days, only to check again today and hear that I have unreturned equipment. I hate this company. I hate them so god damn much. I want my $65.90 but I keep getting lied to about any progress and I have no idea how to solve this. I have another ticket open and was informed that I should receive contact in the next week but it's hard for me to believe it at this point.

Anyone else?Internet went down a few days ago and called the wonderful Comcast help line. They swore it was my modem so I brought it in and exchanged it. After spending an hour telling then I did not want to upgrade my services while they fished around for a new modem I get it home and start it up.... No internet... I call em again and they send a tech out the next morning. Tech tells me another tech had come out and unplugged my house so he could plug in someone else instead. Tech shows me an email to supervisor that I get a $40 credit and that I wouldn't be charged for a tech visit to my house. I say I heard that before....  he said he swears I wont be charged but refused to send me the email so i have proof. well here we are... got charged full price for a tech visit and no credit applied. Now on the phone with the overlords and they have no record that I should have a credit or that a tech visit shouldn't have been charged.

"Xfinity Mobile refused to send my phone to my address, then yelled at me when I called seeking a solution 

My family recently made the mistake of switching to xfinity mobile from Verizon. My mom was enticed by the cheap unlimited data plan, my brother by the device special. At first it honestly seemed like it might be worth it. The service has been identical to Verizon's, and cheaper.

Today I tried to buy an iPhone XR, and I'm now 100% convinced we should have stayed with Verizon.

I go to school at the University of Alabama. Home is in Michigan, which is where my mother's address has the xfinity internet service.

As I discovered when going to checkout, it turns out that is the only place xfinity will send the phone.

I figured surely an exception could be made, so I went ahead and called customer service. After the usual runaround I spoke with a rep who told me they can't break that rule. What a joke! As if it's impossible to separate shipping from billing smh.

I explained to her I live NOWHERE NEAR THERE and she casually told me I should have my mom ship it to me, as if that's no inconvenience whatsoever.

My mother is widowed and certainly has better things to do with her time.

I say ok, can Xfinity at least cover the cost of extra shipping? Silence for about five seconds. I repeat to her, ""Can you do that?"" And at this point she screams at me that my mom's address is the one xfinity has on file and there's nothing that can be done.

I have had a tech come out, and they looked at everything and it all looked good.  They tried their own and it worked and I got 940Mbps, so I went out and bought the SB8200 which is doing the same as the other modem.

From what I have read the power is off. (should be between -7 and 7 dbmV) But to tell Comcast that is like I am speaking Greek. Then my internet went out last Wednesday. A call to Comcast went well, the tech was helpful, and understood that I tried on my own and skipped their trouble shooting steps. But, he couldn't get a signal from my modem and because it was mine and not theirs so they couldn't help me. So they scheduled a tech to come out and they warned that I would have to pay if I was at fault. I already have to pay $261 for my overages, whats another $70 for a tech visit.

&#x200B;

The tech came out in a Xfinity branded van and began his trouble shooting. Signal was fine to him, and my modem was showing good connection, but no internet to speak of. I tried everything, new cable, dropping the router, resetting, rebooting, re-provisioning, no internet, but the modem would shot good/connected. He ran a new thicker gauge cable and still nothing, tried different ports on the tap(the box my house connect to in my neighbor's yard). NOTHING. We  gave up and he left. About 15 minutes after he left, BAMO, I had internet again. (WHAT THE HELL)

&#x200B;

Saturday morning it was out again. Modem showed Connected but no internet in the house. Call to Comcast was less helpful as the tech would not allow me to skip trouble shooting my side. Jesus Christ that was painful.

While their they looked at my account and mentioned that I was in a area with Gigabit. Fucking finally, I was tired of waiting and promptly upgraded as my bill would be lower than my current.

We cant get it to work, I have to explain to him at length basic network things and I try to figure out what he is trying to do. He doesn't like how I setup the modem, swears the signal is good and proceeds to swap out my modem with another. After fiddling around in my neighbors back yard and switching from my 3ft coax cable to his new 3ft cable the internet is working again. He leaves, I move my modem back to the other side of the room on a 25ft coax and proceed to play around with my new Gigabit internet. Ignoring the cable signal that still out of balance.

Ok, now we have the boot img, and I am setup for Gigabit. Still getting 20mbits, cant figure out why. Schedule another tech visit, tomorrow at 3. Fine. Hang up after the conversation ends and go do chores.

30 minutes later I mess a 1-800 number that leaves a voice mail saying its Comcast and I need to call back. Its their advance tech support. Oh goody, maybe they can help. Nope... He proceeds to log into my modem, turn of bridge mode, and tell me my wifi has the same name(2.4 and 5ghz) and it needs to be changed. He does this and immediately says he fixed it and my internet should work now. No, it still giving me 2mbits and I was never on wifi goddammit. Ok, they need to send a tech out to get hands on my modem. Fine, it wont help but fine.

Recently they sent a tech out to my apartment. I'm unsure if he actually did anything because he just knocked on my door said my connection was good and asked me to do a survey for him. I have a suspicion that Comcast is intentionally lowering the speeds to encourage paying for a higher tier. I honestly wouldn't mind paying for a higher tier but I feel like something else is going on because I only get roughly 20% of the speed I pay for.

Sigh, 2 days I have to wait. Tech shows up in a unmarked van(a old ford aerostar)  and proceeds to try to help me. We cant get it to work, I have to explain to him at length basic network things and I try to figure out what he is trying to do. He doesn't like how I setup the modem, swears the signal is good and proceeds to swap out my modem with another. After fiddling around in my neighbors back yard and switching from my 3ft coax cable to his new 3ft cable the internet is working again. He leaves, I move my modem back to the other side of the room on a 25ft coax and proceed to play around with my new Gigabit internet. Ignoring the cable signal that still out of balance.

Tuesday I spend all day at work and assume I will be returning home to no internet. Funny enough I had internet, and its was working fine. Wednesday comes around, get of work and I still have internet. Except now instead of a Gigabit I am getting barely 20 Megabits. But I'm getting my 35 Megabit upload? [https://imgur.com/a/7JYTsdF](https://imgur.com/a/7JYTsdF)

&#x200B;

Hokay, lets call Comcast again. Yay, she skipped my end of trouble shooting and now she is trying her end. Ooops, she has the wrong mac address. Ok, now we have the boot img, and I am setup for Gigabit. Still getting 20mbits, cant figure out why. Schedule another tech visit, tomorrow at 3. Fine. Hang up after the conversation ends and go do chores.

&#x200B;

30 minutes later I mess a 1-800 number that leaves a voice mail saying its Comcast and I need to call back. Its their advance tech support. Oh goody, maybe they can help. Nope... He proceeds to log into my modem, turn of bridge mode, and tell me my wifi has the same name(2.4 and 5ghz) and it needs to be changed. He does this and immediately says he fixed it and my internet should work now. No, it still giving me 2mbits and I was never on wifi goddammit. Ok, they need to send a tech out to get hands on my modem. Fine, it wont help but fine.

&#x200B;

Around the time I was finishing up this wall of text Comcast called again and asked how long I was having issues. And, they would be sending a tech out to check all my connections. Jesus, do you think I didn't try that?

&#x200B;

OK, thanks for reading this wall of text, on to my questions. Am I right that my signal is out of spec? If so, how in the hell do I tell Comcast this? I have tried every way I can think of and they wont listen to me. I have gone through 3 modems and each one has let me down. Right now I am limping along while paying $180 a month speeds I know I can get. This is a yearly thing that happens. I live in Houston and my selection still sucks, its Comcast(up to a gigabit), Att(25mbits - not fiber ready), and DSL.",Comcast
Is Comcast and Ajit Pai modern day book burners?Yes.,Comcast
"Comcast refuses to provide my homes with internetHello, this is my first post and on mobile.

My family owns three homes and one business property all located next to each other on one road. We’ve been trying to get Comcast internet service for years, as they hold the monopoly in our township and the only other option is terrible satellite. In the past, around 2005 or so, they stated that they had no plans on coming out to our area any time in the future. This area included my road and two adjacent roads, around 20-30 houses total. 

Around a year ago, we found out that Comcast ran their lines to every house on all three roads except for our four properties. We’re about 500 feet from the nearest home that has internet, so we’re the only people on the road and surrounding area without service. I called and asked to set up service at our houses (our property showed as serviceable on their website).  They sent someone to do a site visit, where they came up with a price of $14,750 of which we would have to pay $8,500 to make our properties serviceable and claimed it would take 179 days worth of work. I asked my around the neighbors and none of them had to pay anything for any service and their homes hooked up in one day. 

I did some digging into the work they claimed needed done, which included having the power company raise a line on one pole, for $4,700, and to provide permits for Comcast, $3,000, to build on the poles. I called the power company who said this wasn’t true, nothing is wrong with their lines (they came and checked), they charge only $200 for permits, and they’ve never been contacted by Comcast so they are not sure why Comcast quoted this price or where they got their information. I have all of this in writing and voicemails from the power company. 

Of course I went back to Comcast with this and they are now refusing to ever provide our homes with internet, and again have “no plans to expand.”

Is there anything I can do about this? I tried reaching out to some of the executive contacts at Comcast but haven’t heard back. Even if I did pay Comcast’s price now, which I obviously can’t and most likely won’t ever afford, the power company wouldn’t come out and do work because they say there’s no work to be done.

"Comcast Xfinity needs to tell people upfront about the ""Broadcast TV fee""I told Comcast all I wanted to use was internet. Comcast sold a package to me saying that it's internet, with a free TV perk. I asked the Comcast representative to clarify at least three times that there was no TV cost associated with accepting this deal. They say it's completely free, but I check my bill and there is a Broadcast TV Fee of about $13. It is outright deceptive not to mention this. Yes they probably mentioned it in the email agreement, but when the person employed by the company says there's no cost associated with it I felt like I could trust it. Fuck Comcast and their deceptive policies. ",Comcast

"Issues when downloading on gigabit planI'm having a strange issue, and i think it is from one of Comcast's peering points. When I download from varying sources, such as google drive, my personal dedicated server, OVH or other CDN networks. It's really easy to trigger, and I can set it off downloading a few gigabytes from any of the above mentioned sources.

To be clear, my internet connection does not drop just I lose access to major sections of it for a seemingly random period of time. When this occurs even sites such as Facebook become inaccessible, while Reddit still is.

&#x200B;

What I'm looking for is how to get this issue through to comcast as it is a major inconvenience. My guess is something along the route is detecting my legitimate traffic as an incoming DDOS (since I have gigabit download speeds)and nulls further traffic for some period of time. I'm attaching and example traceroute if that helps with anything.

"It's 2019. How bad is bufferbloat today?I'm running pfsense and traffic shaping is an absolute nightmare unless you have a phd in it.  I have a 250/20 connection and I can shape it to a max of about 150/16 until I can't get it to shape the download speed any higher.  If I remove traffic shaping I can get a higher speed but the dslreports bufferbloat test comes in at a 'c'-ish quality.

"I got scammed by xfinity.Here's my story. Last May 2018, we enrolled to Xfinity bundle deals of blast 150mbs + tv and we were paying $60 for it, they also give us an x1 box for ""free"", the lady said might as well give us one coz its free.

After 6 mos my bill was like 70$/month. Initially i thought maybe its the tax that's why I'm paying $10 more. It turns out they're billing me for that x1 box that I'm not even enrolled to, called them regarding that box and they told me that i need to add x1 to my plans to use it and pay more.

Also few months after may, xfinity started to email me that we already used our monthly data plans and whatever exceeds that will be $10/50gb so Sept 2018 i went to talked to xfinity and they told me if we want to eliminate the cap we need to enroll to unlimited data plans which is $50/month.
70+50=120
So i asked them about the gigabit plan, will it eliminate the data cap? The guy from Xfinity said yes and it'll cost us $122 like 2 dollars more. So i told them we'll take the upgrade. Since its almost the same. I confirmed it multiple times that we'll get 1000mbps + unli data. Then
Last month i was billed $168.

Today I went to xfinity and asked them why and told me that i exceeded their data cap. So it turns out its still there. I told them this is what i told, thats why i upgraded to gigabit. they only said to me that ""oh sorry we messed up.""

"Comcast Does Not Try To Retain People Anymore?I was a Comcast customer for 15+ years. I just switched to AT&T about a month ago.

&#x200B;

Every year or so, it was the same old song and dance.... Get some temporary deal, forget about it, price goes up, notice the increase (several months later than I should have), call back and get another temporary deal, rinse and repeat. 

&#x200B;

However, this year it was different. They wouldn't lower the price. They just keep trying to up-sell me (WTF?) with more channels for the same price. At one point, I told them I already had channels X, Y and Z, and they said ""well, you're not supposed to be getting those with your plan""... and, a few days later... POOF...all of those channels are gone. Do they think THAT is going to make me wanna stay? Even less channels for the same price that I'm already not happy with?

&#x200B;

I noticed that AT&T had a deal for 300Mbps fiber internet for \~40/month, so we decided to just cut the cable, go internet only, and use a streaming service (Youtube TV), with Roku.

&#x200B;

When I called Comcast before the switch (give them one more chance to convince me to stay), they wouldn't budge. Said some stuff about ""you won't really get 300Mbps"", etc. But heck, even if I get half of that, that's STILL faster than Comcast's speeds. But they wouldn't do anything about the price. So I switched.

&#x200B;

**Here's my main question. At this point, it's gotta be almost all profit for them. I had the boxes in my house already (which I'm sure that I've paid for 10X over by now) . I'd be just another subscriber, so virtually no cost for them? Why wouldn't they try to offer me some deal for like $50/month for 12 months to keep me from leaving???? Isn't SOME ($50) profit better than nothing??? Plus, once a customer has switched, it should be very difficult to get them back. I WON'T GO BACK, BTW. I also notice that a lot of co-workers are switching to AT&T as well. Does Comcast not care if they lose customers anymore? Just doesn't seem like they're trying.**

&#x200B;

BTW, I loathe Comcast. Always felt ripped off by them with their prices. One time they even started charging me for my own modem.""Oh yeah, we did an equipment audit, and didn't actually know who's modem it was, so we assumed it was ours and started charging you for it until you noticed. We'll take it off of  your bill, and only gave you a credit back to the start of the year."" WTF? Shady AF.

Background:

Since signing up for Comcasts Gigabit service i have yet to achieve anything near 1Gb connection speed.

In the 30 bandwidth tests over the past 90 days the fastest achieved has been just under 500mb.

* [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net) consistently reports the highest speed between 380 and 490Mb.
* Mlab consistently reports the slowest (averaging 250Mb)
* Comcast business speedtest reports about 300Mb
* [Speedtest.xfinity.com](https://Speedtest.xfinity.com) generally reports about 2/3rd the speed that [speedtest.com](https://speedtest.com)

&#x200B;

I have replaced the modem, changed location, tried different channels, etc.

I do not use wireless.

&#x200B;

Both modems reported low power on the end channels. It took a two hour call before being escalated to a department that recoginzied this as an issue.

Then a four call (in which three and half were spent repeating what i told the previous agent as i was punted to different departments) to get an agent to come in and test the connection.

Wire from pole to house was replaced.

Still the fastest i get is 500mb.

Comcast is billing me for Gigabit package while providing midtier service.

Sidenote:

Prior to Gigabit service we had not modified our account since ordering Business Class bleeding edge 50Mb connection speed a decade ago.

Over the years and without requesting it, comcast upgraded our speed to 250Mb. Our bill never changed...service was never interupted and latency was pretty low.

&#x200B;

A server i connect to in Florida regularly showed about a 60ms latency over the 50Mb connection speed.

Since upgrading to Gigabit that same connection now shows 140ms latency.

"DVR misbehavior, biggest issue is stuttering/pausing recording - helpWhen we set recordings, we always allow it to replace an old recording with the new and we tend to float near full (kids shows and such).

I've been a satisfied Xfinity customer. I don't think it's amazing, but I've been perfectly fine with it. Until today.

I got a phone call from someone checking to see if I might want a new service package. I told him what I was interested in and he suggested a new package, but I asked if I'd still get TruTV (since it's probably about 50% of what I watch). The conversation went something like this:

> Rep: TruTV changed to Paramount Network. You will still get that.

> Me (skeptical): Wait, you mean like it changed names? That must have happened in like the last two weeks.

> Rep: It's been like that for a while but some of our grandfathered customers will still have TruTV in their channel lineup.

> Me: So all the content is the same? Like it's the same shows as TruTV?

> Rep: Yep, you'll still have all the same shows.

Well, I looked it up for myself afterward. I'm not sure whether he was mistaken or maliciously ignorant, but TruTV was not renamed to Paramount Network. Both still exist. They aren't even owned by the same company. I'm glad I didn't switch because I would have been *seething* if I didn't find out until it was too late to switch back.

It's frustrating when you're talking to a rep and they can't or won't give you the information you're looking for, but at least you can keep looking. There are few things that are more infuriating than when a rep actively provides the *wrong answer*.

"Xfinity WiFi refuses to connect. Help!I’ve been staying in an apartment for a couple of months for work. I’ve been connected to an Xfinity WiFi hotspot in order to use internet from my apartment. About a month ago, the hotspot seemed to have cut out. None of my devices could connect while I was in the apartment. I called Comcast after a week of nothing changing and they said there wasn’t anything that could be done. The next morning, the internet was suddenly back. Well, here it is a month later and the internet has cut out again. I’ve called Comcast twice and nothing I’ve found online has given me any solutions. I’ve determined that it’s likely the closest hotspot has been deactivated, but all of my devices keep trying to connect to it even though it doesn’t work.

"Long time victim, first time poster.I have had Comcast for about 5 years now. When I first signed up I was done with DSL (the only other option in my area) for it's utter un-reliability. I made the plunge with Comcast, and though the service (read: internet service) has been rock solid, the experiance as a customer has been... stereotypical.

When I signed up I grabbed myself a surfboard for $60 and enjoyed the speed. I have a custom set-up and I didn't want to fiddle with one of their modems to try to get unfiltered internet access. The bill hiked up several times over the next year and after checking it a few times I noticed there was a modem rental fee. I called in and asked about it, (about a 20 min  process) and the rep actually took it off and credited my account. Fairly simple, anyone can make a mistake right? For the next 4 years it happened another 5 times. Each time requiring a call and getting a credit. (With calling in asking if there was a deal I could sign up for to reduce my bill that kept climbing. I just want internet for F sakes!)

Anywho, I recently moved, and I started getting these (I pay for 125 down speeds):

I was transferred from tech support (hahaha) to billing where I was told that their records show that I am renting a modem. I explained the situation to the rep about how this has happened before. The rep then told me I would have to produce a RECEIPT FOR MY MODEM! WTF!? I told her to look at my previous account. After no response for a few minuets I was told that this would be sent to the investigation team and that I would get a reply in 2 - 3 weeks! God I hate these people!",Comcast

"Weird OutagesI have Comcast Business. Every few months the plant for my neighborhood just...goes wonky. For days at a time. It always goes the same way:

1. Upstream speeds grind to a halt. Often 0.2 Mbps if you can even get the upstream side of a speed test to complete. 

1. I call into Customer Support, do the modem reset and call back. Either by the time I call back I get an outage notice or the customer support rep confirms I'm call number 40 about the issue in my neighborhood. Sometimes a tech shows up the next day and only after _they_ get the run around do they finally figure out it's the entire neighborhood and a plant issue they can do nothing about.

1. Outage is marked (and appears) resolved in anywhere from 2 hours to the next day. Though one time it took a day to even admit there was an outage and another two days to fix it.

1. Several 1-2 hour outages continue to occur over the next few days to a week. These outages  are shown on the website and you get the ""there is an outage tech support can't help you"" message if you call in. 

1. All is well for about 2 or 3 months and then the whole process repeats again. 

At this point I just want to know why it keeps happening, TBH. I can't even care that it keeps happening at this point. It's just frustrating. It isn't even my problem, it's always at the plant.",Comcast

"Xfinity Instant TV vs X1?My Internet only 1 year agreement is coming to an end and have option to renew effortesly over website by going with Xfinity Instant TV 10+ + Performance Pro bundle for the same price I am paying now just for the Internet. To get it to work on my Samsung TV, I would have to get Roku though since the smart tv model I have is not supported. It should cost no more than $30-40. It includes HD and DVR. This is for $65.

&#x200B;

I also have deal offered for $90 for X1 Double Play that includes HD fee, but does not include DVR, broadcast, sport and tax fees that would be roughly $18-20 + $10 for DVR if I decided to add to it. So it would be total $110-120. Double Play has 140+ channels. Dunno if I would need DVR, since I think I would be content with On-Demand.

&#x200B;

Instant TV  appeals to me with pricing and option to have skinny bundle with mostly local channels and optional premium networks. How good and reliable it is?

X1 appeals to me with cutting edge receiver and On-Demand library but is its advanced On-Demand really that better than Xfinity Stream's app on Roku?

When I add a router though, nope, nothing. 0.0.0.0 IP address.  I can't renew or request an IP address. I have the same exact setup at my parents house physically and also they are also TP Link products, so this isn't my first rodeo.

* I've cloned my modems MAC address to my router
* I've power cycled the modem, router, and PC
* I updated my router's firmware
* I set my DNS to even comcast's servers

It's a TP Link 7620 modem with a TP Link Archer A7. What exactly am I doing wrong? Cloning the MAC address should have been all that was needed. The router is not passing internet through.

Half the time an employee speaks to me they claim that my modem or router isn't supported or that Cat5e can't achieve gigabit speeds, or that I shouldn't use wireless when I'm literally on a wired connection.

"Anyone switch from comcast --> verizon??I'm a college student with 2 roommates.  When we moved to our townhouse, we got a decent price on a bundle from xfinity/comcast, high speed internet is obviously the most important thing for us since we spend most of our time studying around our laptops.   For the first year, our bill was at or about $77.  Then it hiked up to $97, now this month it went up ANOTHER $10.

I bought a new condo 6 months ago in Chicago and the only option for Internet service is with Comcast. 

Every time it rains, my service goes out. I have had a tech come out 3 times and they came today and finally admitted that the wire from the alley is sending me a bad signal and will be replacing it hopefully in the next couple of days. 

Here's the kicker, after the tech was done inspecting the wires in the alley with me, he went to the opposite side of his truck and pissed on it. Honestly I was shocked and couldn't believe it but he looked me in the eye while I could hear the piss hitting the ground and sure enough, there was a puddle of piss when he left. 

Seeing as I can't switch to a new provider, how do I go about getting credit for service outages and what the hell do I do about this dude pissing right in front of me?  ",Comcast
"5GHz dropped out after declining an upsaleI'm going to preface this by saying that I don't have much technical knowledge, so if I'm off base/misunderstanding principles, please correct me. 

I was on support chat with Comcast yesterday because I missed a month's payment and they implemented a ""soft disconnect."" It was Christmas, I'm a teacher, I have two kids. Sometimes I roll a utility payment over to get through the month. I've never been disconnected before. 

Anyway, while on support chart - after having paid the past due balance to reconnect - I was offered an upsale that I was not interested in. I initially said I might be, but then after having the terms explained to me, I declined. It included an upgrade to a faster Internet speed, and the addition of cable. I don't care about cable and was only interested in the speed increase, but didn't think it was worth the cost. 

Today, every device in my house got kicked off the 5GHz band and we had to connect to the 2.4 band. Is this because I declined? I have never had to switch to the lower band on any device before and I've been using this network for over five years. Is Comcast pulling some shenanigans, or am I just an ignorant fool jumping to conclusions?

TLDR - I said no thank you to increased Internet speed and then lost access to the 5 GHz band on my router.  ",Comcast
"Who thinks xFi WiFi Pods are ""Free"" if you need them? I'm not sure where this started, but that certainly was not the case for me.I had xFi installed a couple weeks ago, so far so good. I was already on gig, but am enjoying no data caps now.

I was under the impression (after several comments on this board) that the xFi pods would be provided if signal strength was not enough across my house, but this was certainly not the case. The tech did not carry them on the truck and was not informed that he even needed to test Wifi strength in my house. His recommendation was that I would need them though based off of my brick home and gateway living on one end of the house (as opposed to the middle).

Anyway, just felt like new subscribers to xFi shouldn't be under this impression. Not sure if this was a local promotion, but in Northeast FL at least the pods have to be purchased BY YOU even if you need them. I don't think you can even bill them to your account.

Of course, YMMV but just hoping someone else doesn't have false expectations like I did.

Bonus: ATT Gig was NOT available at my house until literally last week. Go figure. :D :D

UPDATE: Well I'll be damned, I got the email from Xfinity stating that I could benefit from pods, free to order online. Okay, I'll take them. :D It also said if you cancel Xfi within 90 days they will charge you the $119 for the 3-pack. ",Comcast
"Comcast Triple Play - ARRIS Surfboard SB8200 - DOCSIS 3.1Just a note to anyone out there hoping to reach gig down with Comcast's Triple Play package.  Comcast is offering a service called Triple Play.  The service contains Internet at Gig, TV's, and a VOIP number/service.  As far as I can tell it is the ONLY service they have that offers Gig down, at least in my area.  Their double play and single play packages do not.

ARRIS Surfboard SB8200 is a DOCSIS 3.1 certified router that supports gig down (one of only a couple).  It is certified to work with Comcast and works on Comcast's double and single play packages.

However, you can not buy Comcast's Triple Play and use the ARRIS Surfboard SB8200 to reach the gig down speeds since the ARRIS Surfboard does not have VOIP ports and Comcast's activation process will not let it activate.  Further, there are no commercially available DOCSIS 3.1 cable modems that have VOIP ports on the market.

**Translation**:  If you want Gig down you MUST use Comcast's router/gateway.

I think this is pretty deceptive on both parties.  ARRIS does not work with Comcast's gig down service, despite the marketing materials indicating it will.  Comcast does not allow custom gateways (since none are available and those that are they blacklist).",Comcast
"Help, which box for HD w/o internet?Hi, I’m trying to upgrade my mother’s legacy basic cable SD service to HD and bring her into the modern age.... Comcast Xfinity has thrown us into a rabbit hole of days talking with tech, repair visits, etc. 

SOS?? 

What box should we be requesting that will allow auto-tuning to HD channels without Comcast internet? 

Current problem: they gave us a DTA box, HD channels look pixelated, and they’re only available on channel selection 700+. SD channels have black bars on tops and bottom, not full screen. Auto-tuning to the HD channels doesn’t work but my mother really wants to be able to go to find channels where she’s used to them being. Zooming the picturing on the TV isn’t a solution because then the guide and HD channels are overstretched. 

We’re not signing up for internet with Xfinity to solve this, so we’re told the X1 box isn’t available. They think the DTA box is the problem but they’re not sure. We’re supposed to get an MOT box? They’re sure that will fix it but they were also sure switching to a Digital plan was the issue. They don’t know their own equipment so I figured someone here can give sone guidance.

"High Loaded Latency on Hardwired Connection (w/ 400mbps)Just moved to a new apartment. I have recently started streaming on Twitch 5 nights a week, so a fast and stable connection is very important to me. I purchased 400 MBPS service, and it came with theire XB6 gateway. My up and downstreams have both been great, and my unloaded latency has averaged about 14ms. Unfortunately, my loaded latency has been hovering between 150-900ms for a week now, even when I have my desktop as the only active device connected to internet.

&#x200B;

I thought maybe it was the gateway, so I purchased a new modem and a new router. My bandwidth slightly increased, but the latency issues remained. I have tried a new ethernet cable, and wi-fi connections, and it's consistently high, though the number fluctuates wildly. 

&#x200B;

Yesterday, an Xfinity tech came out and identified it as a ""flux"" problem to my connection from the main end outside, and said it required the attention of a maintenance tech, which could take up to a month to get out. I'm not trying to wait a month, and am curious what else I could do on my end.

&#x200B;

I complained about this on Twitter and @ComcastCares DM'd me. They are sending another service tech out Tuesday, just like the one who came yesterday, likely to tell me the same thing the one yesterday told me.

&#x200B;

Is it possible that downgrading my bandwidth could decrease my latency, as it essentially means traveling with a smaller load? Seems counter-intuitive, but almost dumb enough that it could work. At this point, I would be happy with anything consistently below 100, as I have never seen less than 128 since I moved in a week ago. I am starting to think it really is a ""flux"" problem, as described by the tech, though I really don't know what that means. Anyone got any ideas?!",Comcast

First customer service rep sounded like she hates comcast as much as any of us here. I asked simply if I should expect random increases to my bill. She replied that I should have received notice on my bill and commiserated that no such notice was provided. She apologized but seemed thoroughly disenfranchised. I asked to speak with a supervisor.

The supervisor eventually joined the line. She directed me to the fourth page of my bill, which suggests...

""Broadcast network fees look to recover a portion of the increasing costs from local programmers. These are not government mandated or required fees and will increase from time to time.""

I asked if I should expect random increases. She said no, that this isn't random, that it is noted on my bill.

This is literally on every bill. Therefore, yes, I should expect random changes.

"Upgrade broke my Internet&#x200B;

I've been a customer of Comcast since 2007 and after my last agreement ended, my bill jumped to $242.00 per month. I agreed to a new 2 year contract that would boost my speed to 250 mbps and give me a few channels I wasn't getting with the old plan. The representative told me my old modem would not suffice for the higher speeds so I also had to agree to a new modem and install kit (scam #1 -  this $15.00 kit includes the new modem and the same cables I already had) as well as paying another $15.00 for the shipping of the new modem. They had an issue shipping my new modem so  my service was upgraded 5 days before it got here. 2 days ago I ran a speedtest on the old modem and was getting 245 mbps but I went ahead and switched to the new modem anyway since I had to pay for it. 

&#x200B;

After installing the new modem I ran a speedtest and was shocked to see I am now getting 43 mbps download speed. The first tech I spoke to ran a bunch of tests and signal refreshes and after telling him my service was just fine with the old modem he suggested I just switch back to it since nothing was working for the new modem. After I switch back, the old modem no longer has connectivity because I had to register and activate the new one. The 2nd tech was able to re-activate the old modem but now the highest speed I can get on it is 44.4 mbps. $207.00 per month for downloads in the low 40's...

&#x200B;

Now both techs were very nice but after a combined 3 hours of connecting, reconnecting, sending signals, unplugging and loosening and tightening the same cables over and over again, we've come to the conclusion that I need to contact a different department about my problems between the hours of 9-5 m-f and if they can't fix the issue then I will have to schedule a tech to come out and fix what was working just fine the night before I got the new modem that I apparently didn't need in the 1st place. Upon doing some searches, I see that Comcast is just using contract renewals as a way to get addon charges for new equipment/shipping as well as using your new modem as a ""hotspot"" by default.

"Does comcast charge for unsolicited traffic hitting my WAN interface?Noticed that my internet usage (both packets per second and mbps) went up markedly when i turned on a dynamic DNS domain (via Google domains) for my home network. Is Xfinity actually charging me for unsolicited traffic that I just happen to receive by being on the internet with an easily routeable domain despite my firewall blocking this traffic?

As soon as i turned off my Dyn DNS entry, and my domain no longer resolved, the number of packets has dropped down once again to ""normal"" levels (roughly 25-50% of that previously seen).",Comcast

"Xfinitywifi connectivity issuesI'm having an odd issue with connecting to the xfinitywifi hot spot. For periods of time, I have a set of devices that are all able to connect to the hot spot, which is being broadcasted by my modem as well as some other modems around my apartment. However, during other periods of time, some of the devices are unable to connect to the network. The devices can see the xfinitywifi SSID, but cannot obtain an IP address when trying to connect. The device just fails to establish a successful connection. Then, randomly it will start working again.

Comcast DNS Issues causes down interenet please report on www.downdetector.comGreetings.  My Comcast ISP in Minneapolis MN has been having website connectivity issues for the past few days perhaps a week.  The problem would persist for several hours and then start working.  When I browse I get website not available giving the impression internet is down.  Internet is not down. I can ping Google IP address [172.217.17.14](https://172.217.17.14) but errors when I ping [google.com](https://google.com).  I called comcast and they assured me no problems on the network.   After hours of troubleshooting  I finally caved and added Google DNS [8.8.8.8](https://8.8.8.8) to my DNS server list. (I am anti google BTW). Now it works.   If you are experiencing any problems with comcast or any other service for that matter please go to www.downdetector and report a problem.  I do not think we can trust ISPś to disclose problems,Comcast
Xfinitywifi keeps disconnecting.I am having a lot of trouble trying to connect to my xfinitywifi.

"Chicago - Help me reduce my parents Comcast bill from $300!I'm looking at my parents comcast bill and trying to help them reduce monthly costs.  Before you say get rid of phone, or cut the cord, know that won't be happening.  However, I would like to get the cost down on the existing menu of services.

I see I can reduce the monthly fee on [comcast.com](https://comcast.com) by ""signing up for a new offer"" to reduce the base monthly charge to $139 per month if I sign a 24 month commit, or to $149 for 12 months if I sign a 0 month commit.  Of course, both require me to upgrade from Preferred to Preferred Plus on the TV lineup (220 vs 230 channels), of which I'm sure this difference is negligible.  So negligible there is no difference showing on the channel comparison tool between the two plans.  Certainly, this was also be designed to get you to upgrade so charges are more after the 12/14 months, I'm sure.  My parents are also moving out of state in 16 months, so I""m not sure if that's a valid reason for cancelling the 24 month contract or not.

&#x200B;

Digging deeper into this bill, many of the charges are for adapters, rental fees, and other accessory services.  It's a large house with many people and the base rate can only help so much with this.   Buying the internet modem is probably an easy win, but are there any avenues to reduce the rental fees?  Are there any equipment ""bundles""?  Can you purchase the equipment?

&#x200B;

Finally, there's always the option of getting a quote from DirectTV and seeing is Comcast will match, but let's save that option for last.

&#x200B;

I'm open to any other suggestions.

"New place is strangely wired, trying to get MoCA to work and assessing optionsSo I recently moved into a new place where I can get Comcast xfinity service.  My modem-router is set up in the living room and is working great for all devices connected via wired or wi-fi. The source of this post is coming from one major issue I am having: My PC is located in an office a good distance from the modem-router, and I want it to have a wired connection.

When I scoped the place out I saw there was a coaxial in the office area. From some research I found out there are these things called [MoCA Adapters](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B077Y3SQXR?pf_rd_p=c2945051-950f-485c-b4df-15aac5223b10&pf_rd_r=VWC44JRJB0431VS280NR) I can use to run internet over the coaxial cabling in a household without having to get two modems or anything. Great, this way I can set up my gaming consoles in the living room with the modem-router and the PCs in the office with MoCa adapter, everything can be hardwired and I don't have to run a giant ethernet cable from the living room the office creating a trip hazard all around.

Tech comes out, sets up the modem-router (An XB3, if curious). It has MoCA-capability on it, meaning the modem is already equipped with the ability to 'share' the internet connection over the home coaxial network. Even better. I turn this function on from the router's page, set up my MoCA adapter, connect it to my PC and get ready to tango.

No dice.

The adapter receives power and ethernet connection, but the little light that shows it has a live MoCA connection over the coaxial is dead. I try the coax port in the bedroom (Which is next to the office) and get the same result. I try moving the modem-router to the office and connecting it to the coaxial. No internet.

I call comcast and walk them through this, I have a helpful customer service rep who concludes the coaxial wiring in these other rooms must not be connected to the comcast line in the living room or are faulty somehow. Schedules a tech to come out this week.

Here's where I need to get advice. My understanding is that comcast techs generally charge money for their time. The customer service rep didn't quote me anything but said the tech would have to assess and determine something. I already paid $80 for a tech to come out and install the modem, had I known this would've been an issue I would've absolutely asked that the modem be set up in the office instead of the living room since it's more important for my PCs to have a hardwired ethernet connection. From my perspective this is work that should have been done as part of installation and I should not have to pay more for it.

I don't know how a comcast tech will see this, but I know that my laptop is getting 150 mbps on wireless and almost 300 mbps when connected directly to the modem. My PC does not get this much at all, but I think that's because the wireless card is ancient (10+ years old).

So it's basically pay for a new wireless card (relatively cheap) and see if I can game decently on 150 mbps wireless or see how much a tech wants to unfuck the cabling the situation that should have been unfucked as part of installation. Is there any third option i'm not seeing (besides a ridiculously long ethernet wire from the living room to the office) that anyone could recommend, or ways I could make my case to comcast that this should be done at no additional cost?",Comcast
"Question(s) before attempting to switch to xfinityI’ve been with at&t since they came out with dsl, for a verrryyy long time. AT&T hasn’t really made the “fiber” switch and according to my girlfriends dad whom is the president down in our region says it won’t happen until 2020 and I’m not gonna wait that long to get a decent speed of internet. I get about 6mb MAX download and you can forget about upload but the ping is amazing. Being an avid online gamer and streamer, it’s either one or the other, not at the same time. 
 
I wanted to switch to xfinity because I know a lot of people who say they love it down here in my area and according to my neighbor he friggin loves it but I didn’t get a chance to ask him about installation etc. ive done a lot of reading about technicians coming out and surveying, determining a quote and how much material and so on. I know there is a greenish box by the road of my house maybe 100-200 feet from my home and haven’t seen one in my neighbors yard I don’t believe in which I believe this is what cable companies use to install service to..?(not a 100% on that) 

How much does xfinity or Comcast charge to install/run/bury a line for just internet, I’ve also read where you can have the line ran overhead as well instead of burying if I’m not mistaken. I really want to make the switch and be up to date with internet that’s a lot more reliable and definitely get what I pay for(paying roughly 75$ for a 6mb plan😒).

"Wrong name on my accountHave had an absolutely shitastic experience with Xfinity Mobile. My home internet service is in my name, so when I opened my Xfinity Mobile account I presumed it would also be in my name. Seems logical, right? Nope. They put it in my ex-husband's name (who, btw, has had nothing to do with the xfinity accounts for over a year!) 

The first time I called I was told it was a glitch that they were working on. To check back in a few days. So I did. Account still in his name. Called again and was told to sign off on every device, delete the app, change my username and password, reinstall app and it would be fixed. NOPE. Called back, went through this whole story AGAIN with an xifinity mobile customer service dude who, after 20 minutes of putting me on hold, told me I'd have to call Comcast to get it changed because he didn't have the ability to change such things. 

So, I called Comcast.

"Comcast stores WiFi passwords in plain text, and exchanged modems' passwords are visible to the new owner before registering the modem.Obviously this only applies to rented comcast modems, but if you get a modem from comcast that was previously owned, the network name and WiFi password from the last owner is visible to you on the xFi section of their website prior to you hooking up and registering the modem to your account.

"Just signed up for Comcast - Switched from AT&T... Fees are piling up... Need advice!Hello,

I have used Comcast for 2 years prior to Jan 2018. I switched to AT&T + DirecTV for gigabit and to try out satellite TV. I hated it. 

We switched back as DirecTV was going up to $125/month and internet was $80/month. I don't watch TV.. I stream everything. My sister and I split the bill and she watches TV and prefers to have a set top box.

I signed up on bf and was [told this.](https://i.imgur.com/tDbVapy.jpg) However, [these are my charges... ](https://i.imgur.com/mKMc8Gj.jpg) As you can see, the bill is $5/month more.

I was not told that the starter double play was SD TV with an HD box so you can 'stream HD movies'. So I turn on the TV for the first time 2 days after it was installed and there are weird boxes on my 55"" 4k TV. I call them up and they tell me HD is $10/mo more. I'm like ok whatever... At least now those boxes will go away.

This is now $15/mo more than what I was told.

Today, I go to record a few shows as I hate commercials and refuse to watch TV live... (That and my ADHD doesn't let me sit through commercials very often) I find out the set top box we have is NOT a DVR... For that it is ANOTHER $10/mo more than what was advertised.

I don't watch TV unless it is recorded or online. So, I have finally gotten my sister to a point where she is okay with streaming instead of the set top box... So I ask how much is Internet only.

They tell me 150mbps is $79.99/mo and 60mbps is $49.99/mo.. to stream on 4k TV's and phones we need 150mbps minimum. It is 2 college students and myself (a recent graduate) using the internet if my family doesn't come down to visit. That is 2 TVs, 3 Phones, 1 Desktop, and 2 Laptops online... Not including my iPad or my family's equipment when they come to visit.

I'm saying this all to ask **tl;Dr** Does anyone know if retentions can offer me a better deal? What about a store? My boyfriend told me his aunt just signed up and got 250mbps for $75/mo which we would get in a heartbeat. I live in 32246 zip code if you want to help me look.

"Comcast ripped me off but I was saved by DiscoverI hope this post helps someone who is in a similar situation as myself.  I got out of my contract early by moving to a city they don't service...with some hiccups.

Story:

I had less than a year left in my contract and was moving to a new city.  The city I was moving to did not have Comcast and I was free to get out of my contract **IF** I gave Comcast proof of my new residency.  

I called Comcast July 2018 and gave them 30 days notice explaining the situation. They pulled up the zip code and verified service did not exist in my area.  I signed a document stating that I have 60 days to prove that I moved or I would owe $1081.11

On July 31, I terminated the services with Comcast and the 60 days began.

On August 1st, I moved to the new city and began quickly setting up utilities (this took a minimum of 30 days to get a statement).

Just 20 days later I receive an automatic charge to my credit card for the early termination fee (you should change your credit cards so this doesn't happen to you).

[Comcast Charging Me Early](https://i.redd.it/xz5ajlvwrz221.png)

Angrily, I call Comcast and explain that I'm still gathering the Utility Bills to prove that I moved.  I stated my 60 days are not over and it was unfair they were already charging me the early termination fee.  The representative stated to quickly email in the documents and everything would be resolved.

I spent a total of 4 hours on the phone with 5 representatives (including supervisors!).  Every single representative had a different story.  I did get through to one who told me it was unfair and he took my case personally opening a claim (which I never heard from again).

By now, it's September and I have already emailed all the proof that I moved to a new location.  I have paid the $1081 early termination fee on my Discover credit card to avoid finance charges.

I called and spoke to a representative who told me my **refund** check was in the mail!  ""Thank God, what a relief it's over.""

More weeks pass and...

I call back end of September,  ""Where's my check?"" I finally get a representative to tell me my case is closed!  There is no check and she laughs ""we don't do checks"".  Comcast closed my case without me knowing and the early termination fee will not be refunded.

By now I am raging.  No one at Comcast will listen to my story.  The 60 days have expired.  I have done everything they asked me to do.

I call Discover cards and explained my story.  I report Comcast as FRAUD and Discover gave Comcast 60 days to respond.  I had to upload all the proof again and write out my statement. Silence for 60 days!  I won and got **all my money back** because Discover assisted me!

From beginning to end it took nearly 4 months and guess what?  I'm currently a Spectrum customer....which is...Comcast.  Change your policy Comcast!!!

"Outage for 5-6 weeks now.Hi,

I posted here once before and the advice given didn't solve my problem, so I'm back.

My network has been unavailable for 5-6 weeks now, both on wifi and connecting via ethernet (to router or modem). I've been using the xfinitywifi hotspot during that time. It was suggested that I replace my equipment (3rd party router and modem), so I did, and even with the brand new equipment, I have no access via wifi or ethernet. I've had xfinity techs come out twice, the first time they blamed it on the router (before the new one) the second time they blamed it on the modem (this was with the new one). When they leave, I can always connect via ethernet to the modem, but within a day or two, I lose that ability. 

I then spent 90 minutes with tech support with the router company, and we tried everything she had available to alter it from there as well. She said she thought the connection was unstable, as Xfinity says the connection is reaching my apartment. I'm genuinely at my wit's end. Please, somebody actually fix my internet.",Comcast

First, they try to push to keep you in a bundle, which we don't need. 2nd they WAAAY over charge for their internet only. They know they have a captive audience because they line the pockets of our politicians and cut deals to be exclusive in many areas. If it were available, I could get AT&T fiber with gigabit speeds for less than what Comcrap charges for 150 megabit. I asked this on the phone, I asked why they charge so much and it is kind of just that is the way it is. That being said, 150Mbps has been good so I am sticking with that for now.

So, after all was said and done, the associate sends me a confirmation email, I review everything and right there on the review page it states that Blast Internet will get me speeds up to 50Mbps. So I called her on it, she claims it is a typo on the confirmation page and that we will be getting the same 150 we have had. Can anyone else confirm or deny this typo?",Comcast

Well, AT&T Fiber and Google Fiber are now available in my 'hood. Price is alluring - $60/mo + modem rental/taxes = $80/mo. TV adds $40+tax (so $105 all-in). I have Comcast Triple Play, which has crept over $200/mo.

I spoke to the ""Customer Solutions"" team yesterday. Nice, articulate gentleman. Soothing voice.

He didn't try to retain me - rather, he tried to *argue* about speeds (using [Speedtest.net](https://Speedtest.net)) and pointing out potential additional fees and market availability (all of which was untrue).

Would like some advice. The big issues I have with Comcast are threefold: 1) upstream is 1/10 the speed of downstream (30Mbps vs. 350Mbps); 2) data cap of 1TB (which we hit due to security cameras); 3) Cost of removing cap and going to 1Gbps async is + $80, or \*more than the price of AT&T Fiber\*.

"Post Wire problems rant and advice.Hi all,

In October I had did a self install and everything was working flawless for 2 days. Internet was fine. I only had internet. Then out of nowhere we stop receiving service. 

I call customer service October 31st to schedule a tech to come out. The next available appointment they had was for November 2nd. Okay, not a big deal initially. The tech tells my husband (I couldn’t be there as it’s hard to get time off for my work) that we are indeed offline and a Post Wire needs to be done. We assumed he had closed the ticket or whatever and scheduled for the Post Wire appointment and that they need to communicate with the rental office of my apartment complex for the appointment to take place. Not a problem because I can use the “Xfinity WiFi” public hotspot right. 

Wrong. After using the hotspot up til November 20th we suddenly are unable to use it anymore. We had been using it for Netflix as well as our Xbox One gaming.  Now I’m royally pissed. Representives are useless telling me I should be able to still use it etc and why don’t I use my personal one -_-. 


After several attempts to contact Comcast and my rental office on November 23rd I have yet another tech come out to tell me the same thing that technician on the 2nd said. This tech tells me and my husband that the first tech never put in that it needed a post wire let alone contacting the rental office. The first tech told us that they needed permission from the rental office to do the work on the street. Frustrated my roommate calls the rental office on Sunday and they proceed to tell her that Comcast doesn’t need to have their approval to do the work. 

I schedule the Post Wire appointment for November 28th. I requested that I be off for this day so that I could make sure everything is functioning.  The appointment window was 9 am to 12pm. I check my XFINITY app to see if the appointment is in there and it’s not. It’s 12:30pm. No phone call nothing. I call customer service. The first person tells me the tech is 20-30 minutes away. I wait 1 hour. No tech. I call again. The second rep tells me they have anywhere between 8 am to 8 pm to complete the post Wire but that the rep will contact me when they have an ETA for the rep. No call within the hour. I call a 3rd time same thing. Within 20 minutes after getting off with the 3rd rep (at this point it is 4:00) the tech calls my phone and says they are 45 minutes away. 

The tech asks me where the lines are. Frustrated I tell him the same things I repeated consistently over the month. He looks at the main line tested it. He asks me if there is a main line box. I said I don’t know. All I know is that there is work supposed to be done outside to run it up here. He goes outside. After a few minutes he comes back and says that he needs to have access to the apartments below me (both of which are vacant) to run the wire up to my apartment (we are on the 3rd floor). I contact the rental office. They say that they can’t allow Comcast inside the two apartments below to do the work. I tell the tech and he calls the rental office himself. They say the same thing. 

Now it is December 1st. I still have no internet. The rental office for some reason or another won’t let them do it and another billing cycle has came. I haven’t paid rent yet as I don’t get paid til the 7th. 

My question is if Comcast has issues with Post wire or whatever can I just switch to Verizon without a tech having an issue? I don’t want cable just internet.

i ask this because for the 2 unfortunate years i've been an xfinity customer my dl speeds are always under half of what my plan advertised. when i paid for 100mbps i got around 40mbps. now i have a 60mbps plan and it's hideously slow. speed test results: fast .com says 15mbps while xfinity says 27mbs.

i own my modem, an sb6183.

they're sending a tech out (again) next week and i'm also wondering if the comcast owned modem the tech brings to test the line might have a config file with higher speeds. anyone know for sure if i'm right to be suspicious?


p.s. if you've come to this thread to try to convince me that comcast is not a monopoly or that isps do not behave like a cartel, save your time and just don't.

*** update: so here's what went down: after the 2 years of paying for 100 just to get 50 because they said i couldn't get 50 in my area (huh? was able to get 50 when paying for double)

to lower my bill, comcast on twitter sold me 60mbps but it turned out to be 25mbs. 

bought a new sb6183, new cat6 cables, no wifi, computer direct to modem and the results were exactly the same. it WAS the config file as i had suspected. my speeds were completely due to comcast ripping me off and my equipment was fine.

last phone rep said in my state i can only get 25 or 100 (real 100 doesn't exist locally so that's not true) nothing in between and twitter comcast should never have sold me the 60.

went back to twitter comcast and they checked and said they made a mistake but i could get blast for my state at 50mbps, but that my state has different speeds, prices and plans from the rest of the country and that's why the 60 they sold me was less than half that.

for now i took the blast at 50 for half of what i was paying before but i am exploring the only other alternative at my address which is centurylink. i just found out that there might be a possibility of up to 40mbps via business dsl (on their residential website it said 12 was the fastest, not sure if i trust the 40 claim).

centurylink is just as hated here as comcast so i'm not sure what i will do eventually. may have to set up dsl too and just jump between bad isps to keep from being robbed by comcast in the future.

btw, speeds are now matching the plan i agreed to. this whole thing was never a tech problem and never was, it all had to do with price/speed/availablity comcast capriciously assigned to my state and the fact that 100 calls, visits etc produce an equal number of conflicting diagnoses that have nothing to do with the actual situation.

i've spent my entire week on this and tbh my outlook on this whole situation is very bleak.

"Comcast is saying we’ve used 1TB of data this monthI guess I’m looking for some advice and/or confirmation of what I think is happening. I just got a 90% usage alert from Xfinity yesterday - they say we’ve used 973Gb of data this month. This struck me as really odd, as, 

(1) last year, when they capped everyone’s Internet to 1TB, I checked our usage and we averaged between 300-500Gb every month when it was just me and my partner; we did get a roommate in February, but all he does is stream Hulu for a few hours when he’s home;

(2) after this alert, I checked our last few months of usage, and there’s what I consider a very suspicious 200Gb increase every month since August: Aug was 328Gb, Sep was 556Gb, Oct was 732Gb and, now a week from the end of our bill, Nov is 973Gb; if someone were hacking our WiFi, an almost exact 200Gb exponential increase is still off; 

(3) we have made no drastic changes since August in devices or our uses: we have 3 xboxes altogether (upgraded to an Xbox X last weekend), a Nintendo Switch and (as of last week) a new Qled tv; at most, there’s typically only 2 consoles in use at the same time; we download maybe one game every other month or so, and while there were new downloads with the new tv and Xbox, those were in the past few days and don’t justify the suspicious 200Gb increase every month. 

(4) we are three full-time working adults; we play some multiplayer videogames and we stream online shows. Nothing is on constantly and we’re out of the house for 50-60 hours each every week. 

5) when I called tech support at Xfinity and asked how on earth we were close to our max, the tech told me my phone might be constantly backing up photos to the cloud. A TB’s worth?? 


My question is: is Xfinity skewering their numbers so that they can start charging people for over a TB of data? Am I wrong, and could we possibly be using that much data in a month? We do have our consoles on the quick start mode (sort of like sleep mode), but they shouldn’t be downloading anything while it’s off. The three of us have smartphones, but none of us are what you’d call heavy users of them: we google, Reddit, and Spotify for the most part.

Things we’ve done: 

1- We bought a new modem/router (NETGEAR Ac1900) last night, and will be using that plus maybe some apps to track our own usage. We will be returning the rental from xfinity.

"Comcast cut the cord for me! And thank you for doing what I wasn't ready to do.Former comcast customer, went to directv (sat) for a year, and now that we're moving to a new house, decided to go back to comcast since I have a massive tivo setup. Made the appointment, told Comcast I needed two cable cards for my two tivos.

Decided to get the triple play, with internet and home security. Guy calls 15 minutes before the installation appointment to see if I could be early. Couldn't get there early but I asked him if made sure to bring two cable cards.

""What cable cards?"", he asked.

""The ones I made sure that the lady who took my order put on the install order"", I said.

""Oh, yeah, it's here, but they don't give us cable cards""

""But it's on the order ..."", I said.

""Well they don't give technicians the cards""

""OK,"" I said, ""just come install the internet and I'll have the cable installed later"".

""No can do, have to do the full order, or nothing""

""But I took the day off from work ...""

""Can't do it"" and he hung up on me.

Great start Comcast. I call up customer service, infuriated. They confirm that they don't give cable cards to technicians and I have to pick them up myself. Noted to the very nice lady that it would have been nice if they told that to me the first time. Or maybe if anyone had read the friggin order.

No worries, she told me that my local Xfinity store had the card and even though the technician had bounced my install for a week, she could arrange for installation on the next day. Just go pick up you cable cards and be ready tomorrow morning!

I dutifully went to the Xfinity store. ""We don't carry cable cards anymore, they have to send them to you."" ""But the phone service lady said you have them in stock"". ""We don't carry them anymore""

So I call Comcast to see if they can overnight them to me so I'd have them for tomorrow's appointment. ""No we can't, and you don't have an appointment tomorrow, it's next Monday. Anyway, go to your local Xfinity store they have them in stock."" ""No,"" I said, ""I'm calling from outside the store - they don't have them anymore"". ""But the computer says they do."" ""No ma'am,"" I said, ""I assure you they don't ... would you like me to walk back and have them tell you?""

""No,"" she said, ""I can have them with the technician at your monday install."" ""Are you sure?"", I asked, ""the last consumer rep said they weren't allowed to carry them."" ""Oh, no,"" she said, ""I just have to make sure they're on the order"". Fine, I and my family will wait until Monday.

Monday morning comes, another day off work, and the technicians show on time. ""No sir, we don't have cable cards, we're not allowed, you have to get them at the Xfinity store."" Again, I tell them that they don't carry them. ""Can you just install the internet?"" ""No sir, we have to put in the full order.""

""Wait, what if I have you cancel the triple play, and just move to the internet alone?"" ""Let me call my supervisor"" We wait, supervisor says it's fine. They very nicely install just my internet.

Do quick research, find that PSVue has built in DVR (a must for my wife). Go buy 4 fire sticks. Install the PSVue on each. Very happy family

Thank you Comcast, I may never have cut the cord on my own, but your insistent incompetence, and the suggestion from your own people, got me to do it. Couldn't be happier. Just can't wait until I can get high speed internet from someone other than you - you don't deserve to be in business.

"Is Comcast deliberately charging you for modem that you own too?I've owned my own Comcast modem for 8 years now after renting their modem for a year. However, the transition hasn't been smooth. After first year, they charged me for the modem that I returned back to them, claiming I never returned. When I asked them I had returned their modem a year ago, they asked for a receipt, which I didn't have after a year. So I got overcharged. However, that wasn't the end. Since then once in a while they start charging me $10 for modem rental for the modem that I purchased by myself. I have auto payment setup, but I still check my billing statements. When I call them back, they tell me that's a glitch on their system and refund me the money. However, this thing keeps happening again and again. They have done that twice in past 3 months now. Last time I talked to them, their representative wasn't aware of the problem and it took them an hour to resolve my issue. I really hate spending my time dealing with Comcast customer service. Unfortunately, because of their monopoly, I have to use their service.

&#x200B;

Since this has been occurring very frequently for many years, I have come to the conclusion that they are doing this criminal practice on purpose. So that they can increase their revenue by a good margin, by charging extra from customers that own a modem. I'm pretty sure not all those customers with auto payment check their billing statements. I highly doubt it's a software glitch, because it hasn't been resolved for years.

Can't do it online because every page I go to pertaining to moving services only tells me ""Congratulations, Comcast is available at that address"" and gives me a number to call.

I called in this morning to try and get it sorted. What followed was a conversation where the rep said I had to be signed up for a completely new service. First tried to sell me some home security system package with internet that I didn't need, and I had to tell him four times I didn't need that - I JUST want internet. That is all. I play MMOs, I work from home. I don't need anything else.

So he finally signs me up for a $45 a month performance plan. Except, there's no order number for the setup and I can't see it on my account. They also did another credit check. I called back in because I had no email or anything even saying an order was placed, and they don't even see an account set up for the new service.

Just....how am I supposed to do this? Am I better off just going in person to see if someone will actually listen to the words coming out of my mouth and not just try to sell me stuff I don't need? I just want to transfer service - why does this require a new account?  Was a new account even made.

"Comcast wants me to pay $7000+ to have cable ran to my house.I am located in GA and me and my wife just moved in to our newly constructed home. When I checked availability of internet service to the new address, Comcast's website said that service was available. 

About three weeks ago I scheduled for Comcast to come out hook up cable to the house as we would be moving in soon. The tech arrives to our location and instantly says he can't do the job, that the construction department needs to come out and run cable to the house. He also told us that this will likely be expensive and that someone will call us to schedule a visit. After about a week of waiting we contact Comcast again and say no one has contacted us and that we need to have cable run to the new house. The representative on the phone says no problem and schedules the appointment. During this phone call we ask them about pricing and that the previous technician said it would be expensive. The representative on the phone assures us that this is wrong and we won't be charged anything other than the one time installation fee. 

The appointment day comes and another tech shows up and tells us that he cannot do the job that we don't have wires run to the house. We explain to him that we discussed this at length with the representative on the phone. This tech again tells us we need to contact the construction department. At this point my wife goes up to the physical Comcast building and ask to speak to the construction manager. She is informed that he is not in the office in the afternoon and the receptionist supposedly emailed him to contact us the next day. 

Two days go by and again no contact from Comcast. My wife emails the receptionist and gives her both our phone numbers and both of our email addresses. Again no contact. My wife then goes up there today and the receptionist tells her that they have been trying to contact me all week. This is a lie as I have no voice mails or emails from them. It is possible they called while I was at work during which time my phone is off but still they didn't leave any messages. The construction manager tells her that to install lines to our house it will cost $7000+ and there is no payment plan options available. 

For reference my neighbors have Comcast internet and the street connection is currently at the end of my driveway. I do have a pretty long driveway, I am about 800 ft from the road while most of my neighbors live close to the street. There are also already poles running down my driveway for electricity to be supplied to my house. I could understand if we had to pay money for an electrician to run cable from the box on the street to my house but I think over $7000 is very excessive.

"How to stop harassing unused equipment calls???Hello everyone,

* I had Comcast for about 4 years while I lived in my apartment near my university.

* I am no longer a Comcast/Xfinity customer.

* When I signed up and had the guy install everything, and he told me that when I move out I should simply leave my equipment at the apartment.

*  I don't know if this is an important detail, but about 2 years in my apartment complex was bought by another company.

Anyways, I canceled the service when I moved out in July. About a 3 weeks after I started getting spammed with about 5-6 calls a day from spoofed phone numbers requesting that I return my unused equipment. My online account shows nothing owed, and I have not received anything in the mail about this. 

One time I answered the phone and there was someone obviously in India named ""Eric"" on the other side. I explained exactly what I just said here: that I moved out and was instructed to leave the equipment in the apartment. ""Eric"" said that was just fine and that no more action was needed on my part. 

About a week past and then they started up again, using different spoofed numbers. The number of calls also increased. I read somewhere that Comcast contracts this out to collectors, and what I think may be happening is that these fuckers just re-sold a list containing my name to make money. 

Who can I speak to in order to make this shit stop? It's not affecting my credit since I don't owe anything, but it's really fucking annoying as I am job searching at the moment and I sometimes can't tell if its a legit number or if I am getting a callback from the hundreds of jobs I am applying to. 

I'm afraid that if I just talk to them again, the same shit will happen and escalate.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

"Can't Access Certain WebsitesHello,

Recently I got a new router from Comcast after my old one started to sporadically cut off internet access and ever since then I have been plagued with the Xfinity Activation screen whenever I access some websites.

For example, if I go on [Camopedia.org](https://Camopedia.org) (yes I like looking at different camo designs) I am prompted with the black Xfinity Activation screen as if I never activated my service before, which I had to do because I wouldn't be able to make this Reddit post from my own home without it. To be more specific the page I'm directed to is this one: [https://register.be.xfinity.com/activate](https://register.be.xfinity.com/activate) and before I could just do the activation over and over again to access that page but eventually it told me: ""Sorry, we can't find this device."" and now I'm left without access to the more obscure parts of the internet and what worries me is that if I come across a problem and need a quick solution I can't access it because Xfinity wants me to activate their service and I'll have to resort to using my data to find that answer which isn't efficient for me at all.

"Degraded upload speeds, support say signal is fine. I'm getting no help from them!Posted in the Comcast_Xfinity subreddit, but wanted to  complain here as well. I'm not getting much support from comcast, despite having service issues. I understand the issue is strange and hard to track down, but they are not owning up to it and helping out. 

Original text: 
Comcast customer in Chicago suburbs, I have a personally owned modem, personally owned router. My modem has several LAN ports, and I use some of them for hardwiring devices.

I've been experiencing intermittent degraded upload speeds the last several weeks. The problem tends to start in the evening, but not at any specific time. It is most notable because there are two gaming systems in the house, and gaming becomes problematic. Voice quality over party chat is affected (the other people we are playing with say our voices are choppy and low quality). We notice more lag in game. Download speeds remain solid during this time however.

I can run a speed test from several devices, laptops over wifi, game system plugged directly into modem, computers plugged in either modem or router. All devices show decent download speed but very poor upload speeds, mostly less than 1 Mbps, sometimes as low as 200 Kbps.

During the day time, we experience no issues, and speed tests done throughout the day show a full 8-10 Mbps upload speed.

I've had technicians out twice. Once during the day time, (upload speed as expected at the time), and once during the evening (upload speed degraded). Both technicians on both visits checked every part of the line to our house from the pole all the way to the inside of our house. They said the lines and signals were good.

During the second technician visit, I was skeptical of the ""good signal"" claim, and the technician rebutted me, saying that it was probably my modem, and since it's not a comcast owned modem, he wouldn't troubleshoot that.

I had a strong feeling it wasn't my modem (or any other line, or infrastructure since the problem is so intermittent and starts in the evening). So I went out to the store and bought a new modem. I plugged it in and had support activate the modem. Sure enough, the problem persisted. Another thing the 2nd technician did was schedule what he called a 'line check"", I have no visibility into whether this was completed or what they found.

So to recap, I have troubleshooted all aspects of the problem. I experience the problem in the evening only, but when I do, I see it across all devices in all configurations. I can remove my router completely, direct connect a laptop to the modem, and I get bad upload speed. I get bad upload speed when my router is plugged in and we are using all of our devices.

I've tried expressing this to the various support people I've talked to, but I just get the canned ""Oh have you tried rebooting? How many devices are on the WiFi?"" responses. I had one support person over chat disregard all of my description of the problem, and just dump me to a modem activation support rep.

At this time, I really need escalated support. I need Comcast to provide me some sort of test that I can perform and record my results in, so I can point to hard data that my speeds are affected. I need someone more than just the techs that know how to connect the coax line from the alley to my house. I've done all the troubleshooting already.

This problem is so weird, but so specific, that I'm convinced it has to be some configuration on Comcast's end.

"Xfinity Pods - devices not connecting to best optionI bought a 3 pack of the Xfinity pods a few weeks ago and am having mixed results with them. My main purpose for purchasing them was to extend the wifi reception to a studio I have out in my back yard. The pods were able to do this and I had set them up by daisy chaining them a little. However, I have been experiencing a fairly substantial downside with them.

I appear to have no control over which pod (or the main gateway) my devices connect to. According to the product description, they are supposed to automatically connect to the ""best"" option. However this does not appear to be the case. Even as i type this, I am about 10 feet from the main Xfinity gateway, where I would normally get around 60-100 Mbps. However, my laptop has decided to connect to the pod at the back of my house, and I'm only getting around 5Mbps.

This seems to be a common problem no matter what device I use and in each room. The device neither seems to select the closest, or fastest option.

Has anyone else experienced this and if so is there anything I can do to manually select which pod (or main gateway) I connect to?  Alternatively, if I cannot get this fixed I will probably return the pods so if anyone has alternative suggestions on how to boost the network so I have wifi in my studio at the back of the house I'd be interested to hear.

"I’m essentially forced to stay with Comcast for the next year. How can I avoid my bill doubling?Hello, 

I live in an apartment with my boyfriend, and for Internet, our two options are either Comcast or Frontier. 

My understanding (and somewhat experience) is that Frontier’s internet service is just as terrible as their customer service, but at least with Comcast, I get internet consistently. 

My contract will end in December. I need to get a new plan by January 17th, which is when the first bill at the higher rate will be written. I currently pay $29.99 for just internet. We don’t need cable or anything else. 

Every time I talk with Comcast to discuss my options, the “best price I can get” increases. Originally my quote for the next cheapest option was $34.99 which would be $44.09 including taxes and my autopay deduction. Then, it was a minimum of $55 after taxes and deductions. This is about what my bill would be if I do nothing. I can not afford this. I need the most  basic internet package available. 

We have seriously considered threatening to just cancel our service and then, if they call our bluff, having my bf get a plan under his name, but my understanding is that we could be without internet for several weeks if we do this.

"Consistently high packet loss for several yearsAlthough I do not live at home with them, my parents pay for 150mbps high speed internet yet speed tests sites (even the Comcast one) never go above 15, 5mbps usually. Which wouldn’t even be terrible if it didn’t come with **45% packet loss** also. 

All of this started about 4 years ago while I still lived with my parents. They had fantastic consistently fast internet then one day, it turned to shit and never came back. I encouraged repeated calls to support including a heated argument with a technician at one point as I showed him ~50% packet loss on a wired connection and he told me that was normal... We tried AT&T (the only other internet provider in the area) and they only offered dialup which, despite having a more consistent connection, was too slow for video streaming at less than 1mbps. 

I moved out since then but it is absolutely wrong that my parents are being cheated like this. I visit weekends about once a month and nothing ever changes.

I took advantage of the iPad offer back in August. Today is Novermber 11th, and I still have not received my product, though I have been billed for it.

Twice, Xfinity has shipped it to me. Twice I have not been notified until after Fedex has attempted to deliver, and the device returned to Xfinity. I’m not asking for much, just a tracking number at the time you ship it. With that in hand I can be home to receive and sign for it. Please consider : This last time you shipped the device on October 31st. The Xfinity reward website did not update until Novermber 7th, showing me that it had been shipped and giving me a FedEx tracking number. I immediately tracked the package, and lo and behold Fedex had attempted the delivery on November 2nd. That’s right, they tried to deliver it 5 days BEFORE Xfinity provided me with a tracking number. How could I have know it was coming? There’s no one else here to sign for it. And though I asked on several occasions to get the tracking info asap, and though I have been told the issue has been escalated and the person who’s got the ticket would be in touch, no one from Xfinity has called or emailed me. 

I am extremely disheartened , Comcast. I pay nearly $5000 dollars a year to you, between my Triple Pay package and my Xfinity mobile service. I’ve up until now been both happy with my service, your customer service, and as a result have always recommended you to by friends and family. I don’t think I can do so anymore.

"Preparing for self installHello. I'll try to give as much of a full picture without useless information as much as I can.

We bought our house a little over 3 years ago and up until the other day we used Comcast for internet and voice and DirecTV for our TV service.

Keeping them separate got too expensive so I bundled everything to Comcast the other day. My self install kit and equipment should be arriving tomorrow.

For internet I own my own gateway/modem in bridge mode and Asus rt-ac68p router since I've already had Xfinity internet and voice, the main Comcast run is already in the house. It is an rg6 line. The previous owners must have had Comcast for all their services at one point because the main line is connected to a 4-way splitter with each output at 7db, but the only thing currently connected is the modem.

We will be receiving the main x1 DVR box as well as 1 additional HD box.

There are enough runs to the basement closet between all the DirecTV and previous Comcast runs that I dont have much wiring to do.

What I'm curious is if the current splitter I have will be sufficient considering each output is 7db or if I should get a 3-way and put the modem on the 3.5 db output or if I'll need an amp due to the signal requirements of x1.

"Just need to ventSo I spent \~45 minutes in a chat with a Comcast employee that should have taken 5.

**Backstory**

I recently upgraded my TV channel package to make the wife happy. We use the Xfinity Stream Roku app to watch said channels. We had two old boxes that I never got around to returning so after making the change to the account we returned the boxes because it would save us another \~$8 per month in rental fees. The employee that helped me with the change assured me this wouldn't be an issue. After returning the boxes the new channels disappeared from the Stream app. So I got back in touch with Comcast.

**Present Day**

My first question in the chat was ""Do I need to have a cable box active on my account to gain access to all the channels I pay for?"" Made it very clear that we don't use the boxes but instead use the Rokus to access our channels. After repeated ""testing"" and ""health checks"" she very politely told me that it appears you need to have a cable box active on the account in order for all channels to appear.  So now I have to pay an additional $2.68 per month to access the channels that I already pay for. Here's the best part: As soon as the order went through the channels came back. I don't even have the box yet and never plan on taking it out of its packaging.

"Comcast is tiringWe moved in a year ago. My partner set up an account. She was sent a bill for next month saying it would leave the ""promo rate"" and jump to almost double. I called and was told that if I called back on the first, they would be able to offer the promo rate again. It wasn't available until November. They claimed to put a note on the account.

Called on the first, was told no, that promo isn't available. The only promo available was $20 more for faster service. I said no and cancelled the account to put it in my name.

I called once to see what the cheapest promo was. They didn't have the promo they mentioned, the one that was what my partner had for the past year. They only had the same service for $10 more. I hung up to check if any other providers in town had better prices. They do, but don't serve out apartment. Called back.

Aside from dealing with an automated system that seems to actively work to keep customers away, I was transferred to three different departments because first they thought it was a business account, then they thought it was an existing account, then they got me to new accounts. I had an account at a different apartment as of a year and a month ago. They didn't bother to find it. This will be an issue.

I was told the promo was the same as my partner's not promo price, almost twice the old promo. I said no, there is cheaper. He said ""oh, wait, yeah,"" and found the one that was $10 than what we had for a year. Because he didn't find my old account, he gave me two options: 1. autopay 2. credit check and monthly bills. I said I want a monthly bill because they like to sneak things onto bills. That meant a credit check.

"Comcast Business Fiber sucks!So our business has business fiber with Comcast, so that means we have a SLA with them two hour response for outage no matter what time of day. So first outage we had Comcast said their was a cut fiber and will take one hour to fix the fiber, no biggie at least I’m getting credit for it. So the next day we still have no internet, I call them up saying “what’s going on you said one hour repair time and nothing has been fixed” the representative said to us “I am sorry but you bin told you have standard internet with fiber and your problem should be fixed within two days”. Mind to you WE do have a service level agreement and a contract stating “All repairs will be done within four hour period”. The representative said “Comcast Business Dedicated Fiber has no SLA in their service”. To this fix point I said let us cancel your service since you haven’t met are contract and the service level agreement, stating “we are allowed to cancel to services with no early termination fee’s”. Of course the representative just gets angry and threatens me to add more fee’s.
For that I just hung up and went to call again, This time we called one of the managers let’s name his “Tom”. Tom knew other representative was totally out his way and shouldn’t be treating  customers this way. When Tom was looking are the service level agreement and contracts that my legal team signed for. He helped us to cancel the service, but I am still not happy about about the customer service, mind to you we have a 10gig symmetrical line, but also we had many outages and never got credited for the outages.
But for Tom who helped us wonderful to help cancel the services, when we are service level was agreement wasn’t met.
Still Comcast dedicates fiber sucks and to expensive for a third tier internet service provider.

Now we are with AT&T dedicated 10gig line, with a stronger service level agreement and contract. That states “any or made outages outside of dermac point, will have 30-1 hour repair window, above 1 hour you shall be credited for one month of downtime.”
Psst AT&T 10gig dedicated fiber is much much cheaper then we paid with Comcast.

"Comcast doing away with 25/mbps plan?Prefacing this by saying that I live in the Northern, VA area and have been a Comcast Xfinity customer for around 3 years now. I joined Xfinity on the 25/mbps plan at the starting special of $29.99 (Definitely a good deal). The following year it went up to $54.95. I called in and they found a no contract special to bring it back down to $49.99. The $49.99 price has been set for the past couple of years.

This year, I got a notice that I was being upgraded to the 60/mbps tier for free. I called in and asked the rep if there would be any increase in price. He ensured me that there wouldn't be and that Comcast was most likely removing the 25/mbps tier and upgrading everyone to 60/mbps. Fast forward half a year and I have now seen my $49.99 bill go up to $66 and now $69.95.

I called back in today and asked if there are any promos or discounts for internet only plans and there are none currently being run. The really interesting thing is that the rep said that their performance starter internet (25/mbps) is available at the every day price of $49.95. Looking at the Xfinity website, the performance starter tier is listed at ***15/mbps not 25/mpbs***. I mentioned that to her and she didn't seem familiar with the online tier/pricing.

I'm guessing Comcast is ""upgrading"" people in certain areas to a higher tier, telling them the lower/cheaper tier is being dropped, and then gradually increasing their monthly bill to that new tier's every day pricing. For the most part, I've been happy with Comcast's service but this seems rather dishonest to push people to a higher tier and then tell them the lower/cheaper tier is being done away with when it actually isn't.

"I'm a tech and here's why your tech did a bad jobComcast has a business model for entry level employees (techs, call centers, etc.)  to make them feel inadequate.  If they feel like they didn't do enough, they'll do more, right?  No.  They'll just try to make the system happy which leaves the customer screwed.  Here's how it works:  There's a point system for types of jobs.  Your stuff not working and it's been installed is worth 16 points.  You try to install stuff yourself (Self Install Kit/SIK) and it doesn't work is worth 29 points.  Installations vary by the number of items to be installed, what services you're receiving....basically, the more you pay a month, the more points the install is worth.  I've seen as high as 96 points for an install.  You can already see a problem with SIK.  You were somehow expected to install 5 items?  No, but the salesman told you that if you try and it doesn't work, a tech will come do it for free.  They sure will.  They're also going to try to adhere to the points, 29, or they're going to catch hell for being unproductive.  So they hook up all 5 of your digital items with the analog cable system in your house as fast as they can and you now have issues.  Now you have to have another tech come out. That's a troublecall.  16 points.  Even less points than the last guy and he has to do everything the last guy didn't do.  For less.  So he does the fastest get-by job possible and you're still screwed.  So what if you read this before your install and you think, ""I'll just pay for the installation and have it done right.""?  That SHOULD work.  Not always.  If your tech is behind on this ridiculous point system for the month, he's still cutting every corner he can.  There is a ton more to it all than what I'm putting here.  There is a test the tech has to complete successfully before he can complete the job and move on.  This test is treated as infallible but it is incredibly inaccurate and has no business being anything more than 'at a glance'.  Techs have to waste a ton of time trying to get this thing to give them an accurate answer.  It's based off of signal recordings on your modem and X1 devices.  Those devices were never meant to be a meter and so do a terrible job of recording this stuff accurately.  It's why a tech may have swapped out your modem for some bs reason.  Think of it as turning the spare bedroom into a nursery because a pregnancy test from WalGreens came up positive.  Nobody does that because everyone knows those tests aren't the most accurate.  Comcast doesn't care if the test is accurate.  They'll still hold techs up at least once a day at a house over it and that time wasted has to be made up somewhere and that's why your tech did a terrible job.

If you get a contractor, you think you're ok?  Nope.  They're paid by the job based on the credit that job is given.  Very similar to the point system above.  So if that tech is working for the credit instead of what the job deserves, you're going to be left with a badly done job.  I left Comcast due to them preaching accountability and then putting all accountability on entry level and went to work as a contractor.  My last house I was at had accidentally unplugged the amp.  Before the amp had been unplugged, everything was working great.  I plugged the amp back in, everything came back up, and the test I mentioned before failed with completely impossible and inaccurate readings.  I spent 4 hours at that house.  Made $16 for 4 hours because of a ridiculous job scoring system.  Hopefully, my landlord will understand because this kind of crap happens a lot and I can't afford rent.  Wasn't the Civil War fought over people not paying people for the work they did?  I guess the founder of Comcast and his son, who has taken over,  were from the deep south so I can see where this mentality comes from.",Comcast

"PSA - Data Usage Messages and HTTPEarlier this morning, I found that I was unable to connect to websites using HTTP; sites would only load when using HTTPS. Being the network junkie I am, I began working back from my equipment trying to isolate the issue. After some quick experimentation, I found that I was able to use any service other than HTTP with the raw Comcast connection, and that HTTP did indeed work when I routed it through a VPN. It was at this point that I remembered that Comcast performs Man in the Middle attacks on their customers' HTTP connections occasionally to inform them that they've blown through their data cap, or that they have an active copyright notice (see [https://www.neowin.net/news/comcast-begin-man-in-the-middle-attacks-to-show-copyright-notices-on-websites/](https://www.neowin.net/news/comcast-begin-man-in-the-middle-attacks-to-show-copyright-notices-on-websites/) for some further reading on the subject). Furthermore, I received a text message about blowing through the cap last night.

&#x200B;

As it turned out, the system that Comcast uses to initiate the MITM attack was failing to work properly. This led to me being unable to load HTTP content.

&#x200B;

The solution? I called Comcast and had them check for any unacknowledged notices regarding my data cap. There was indeed such a notice. Once they acknowledged it from their end for me, everything began working as it should. I asked them to escalate the ticket to their engineering team so they can investigate why the problem occurred and work to prevent it from occurring in the future.

&#x200B;

Until the issue is resolved on Comcast's end, hopefully this can shine some light on what might be a very confusing issue for many users.",Comcast

A group of friends and I run a dedicated server hosted by Leaseweb in The Netherlands data center. We operate an open source private streaming platform on it. When watching video on the platform, during the day time hours connection it is fine on Comcast. In the evenings, around 7:30/8 pm, the buffering/download speed from the server drops dramatically. The problem does not seem to occur on other ISP's I've tried. We cant find any cause on the servers end (no one else is experiencing the issue) and I've tried multiple devices and connected directly to the modem to rule out hardware here at home. I need someone to verify on Comcast's end that there is no throttling or interference with the traffic on Comcast's end. The fact that it drops nightly at a specific time until early morning is suspect to me, and since its occurring while directly connected to the modem I was wondering if there was some sort of peak hours throttling causing the problem.

"Triple Play Modem Options?Ok so I just found out that my intermittent, persistent latency issues is probably related to my Puma 6 chipset in the rented TG1682G modem, and am looking to replace it with another.

&#x200B;

We have the 250 mbps plan, and the modem is in bridge mode connected to a Netgear Orbi system. We get good speeds, but it often takes a while to connect and when I'm playing games, I get a lot of lag spikes. Wiring my xbox directly to the orbi satellite helped (and I get 250-300 mbps on [fast.com](https://fast.com) in the xbox web browser) but did not totally cure the issue.

&#x200B;

Therefore, I don't need a combo modem/router inherently. I was looking at the xfinity my device options, and I have 3 options: Arris SVG2482AC, Netgear C7100V, and a standalone Netgear CM500V.

  
The Arris SVG2482AC has the same Puma 6 chipset, so that is out.

&#x200B;

So I am looking between the C7100V for $300, which obviously will work but might be overkill.

&#x200B;

And the CM500V which is only $100 but is rated for lower speeds overall. And this comparison site ([https://stickystatic.com/tech/approved-voice-modem](https://stickystatic.com/tech/approved-voice-modem)) says it is not adequate for speeds over 200 mbps.

&#x200B;

I have read some other things that said the CM500v will be OK for speeds up to 300 mbps.

I paid everything I owed and closed my account. That was in early 2016.

Fast forward back to this week. After I submitted my info for proof of resistance, comcast lifted the block on the address and replaced it with another block for a $50 collections on an address that I never lived in. (Technically same address different apartment number). After talking to a couple of representatives, no one could tell me what the $50 is for or why I was even charged in the first place. I was trying to get services set up for that apt when the ceiling collapsed and we had to move to a different unit (this was 2014). I cancelled everything and should have never been charged anything under Comcast's ""30 day money back gaurantee.""

So now my credit is probably being affected bc comcast sent me to collections for a $50 charge from 2014, and they can't tell me what the charge is for. I also can't set up new service until that $50 is paid.

"Live in 2nd floor apartment. Son moving in downstairs. Want to split cable and InternetSo I own a 2 flat currently fitted with Comcast internet and Cable. My son is moving in downstairs. We're in a major market city and  obviously don't want to be screwed more than Comcast already does. 

As far as internet goes, is it as simple as running an ethernet cable down to the 1st floor unit connecting it to a router?

and Cable? Has anyone done this before? Do I call and ask for a cable box in the bedroom and give the guy $20 to actually run it downstairs? Have him set it up as i requested and move it myself afterwards?

Thanks",Comcast

"So how do I get Comcast to stop sending me other peoples account info ?
Looks like someone signed up with Comcast with my wife’s email address. 
Comcast seems unable or unwilling to fix it. Which is frustrating her. 

At this point we consider it unwelcome spam. 
Though it is probably a privacy policy violation for them to keep sending her the account info. 

Any ideas ? 
Or just spam filter the whole thing ?

"DTA overlay cut offMy grandmother's Pace RNG110 DTA is outputting a 4:3 overlay to her 16:9 TV, but rather than scaling it down to fit height-wise it just chops off the top and bottom to fit it width-wise. The channels themselves display fine, as a 16:9 image fitting the TV perfectly and with nothing cut off. She can watch any show without issue except in as much as the guide and other overlay elements are partially cropped out, which is a big problem when I try to turn on closed captioning for her.

I've checked the TV's display settings to make sure it doesn't have some peculiar zoom enabled (like a pillar boxed 16:9 signal which is being zoomed back into a 16:9 image), and I've checked the DTA's settings to ensure it's in 16:9 mode rather than 4:3 (by powering on the DTA using the menu button to access settings not available in the normal settings menu). They're connected with an HDMI cable. I've tried turning on the TV's own closed captioning in the hope that the DTA might pass the data through to it, but no such luck. The overlay is the old light blue one cable boxes used to have which was designed to show up on terrible CRTs so I'm not surprised there isn't a 16:9 format of it, but I'm really hoping there's some way to get it to scale properly over a 16:9 image. Anyone encountered anything like this before, where the overlay is cropped but the picture itself isn't?

Edit: On the off chance someone else runs into this problem, the tech that came out solved it by swapping the HDMI cable for composite.",Comcast
"Why is it so hard to change your Dynamic IP with Xfinity?I reset my modem and it didn't work.

"Comcast sent me a router that they didn't bill me for, can I use it?Okay soo, I used to rent a router from Comcast and it's been over a year or so. When they sent me the equipment, after a few days/weeks, they sent another modem and I never got billed for it, nor did I use it. It's just been sitting in its box for over a year now and it seems like they never bothered with it. 

Now, I wanted to downgrade my service but they wouldn't offer me the new customer price (which I think is stupid, typical Comcast) so I cancelled the service and will be starting a new one. I am returning the equipment and was planning on using my own. My question is, do you think I can use the modem they sent me? I am sure they must have a record of them sending it to me in their database somewhere but if I plug it in, will it pick it up and they will bill me for the full amount or something?  

If they will, what should I do with it. I can drop it off with the other equipment at UPS but i'm not sure if they'll bill me for it since I've been sitting on it for a while and they never noticed, anything can be expected of them. ",Comcast

I have an anal, overbearing, psycho landlord (no I can’t afford to move- I would’ve by now) who suddenly hates wires on his apartment building. He wants “house boxes” (he doesn’t speak English well) installed on the building to reduce the amount of wires. He harangued the tech fixing my service into submitting a request.

What does this mean for my perfectly decent service that I use to work at home?

What kind of downtime can I expect because of his psychotic behavior?

[According to Arris](https://arris.secure.force.com/consumers/articles/General_FAQs/SB6183-Cable-Signal-Levels), they say the recommended max is 51 for my SB6183 modem.

It seems to be fluctuating about 1-2 points right now, usually 51-52, and it just went a bit higher to 53.3 on one of the channels which is the highest I've seen it. [\(modem screenshot\)](https://puu.sh/BKvtS/4ca57593a7.png)

"Comcast Unlimited Data Usage QuestionMy family has had the Comcast Unlimited Data Usage as we go well beyond our data cap of 1TB (we pay an additional $50 per month). Before we went on this plan, we had used up two of the ""courtesy months"" back in December of 2016 and January of 2017, and ever since February of 2017, we have been paying for the unlimited data usage. However, we were told that every 12 month period, we receive two courtesy months where we basically get a ""pass"" for avoid having to pay the $50.

This thus led me thinking on whether we can turn off our unlimited data usage for the next billing month, and the following one, and then re-enable the unlimited data usage plan. But before I even do all of this, is this exactly how the system works? I have talked with the agents, and then chatted with an agent and I am hearing conflicting information. One person said it's two courtesy months for the life of the account, the other said its two courtesy months for every 12 month period. Would someone who is in a similar plan mind clarifying if I would be able to use my ""two courtesy months"" or does it not exist once you use it during the life of the account?

"*ONE SPECIFIC* xfinitywifi hotspot is not doling out IP addresses...... it just so happens to be the one that I can reach from my AirBNB.

&#x200B;

*FULL STORY BELOW*

I am from New Jersey. For the last 2 months, I've been in Baltimore (3 hours away) on a work assignment.

&#x200B;

The wifi in my AirBNB is horrible, so I have been using an xfinitywifi hotspot which I can reach from my AirBNB.

&#x200B;

For 2 months, it has worked perfectly.

&#x200B;

This past week (Monday, I think), it stopped working.

&#x200B;

I was too busy with work things to troubleshoot it this week, but I tried to connect each day and it did not work all week.

&#x200B;

This morning I finally had time to troubleshoot.

&#x200B;

I have tried to connect with 5 different devices:

&#x200B;

2x laptops

2x phones

1x Amazon Fire TV stick

&#x200B;

All exhibit the same behavior: They cannot get an IP address from the hotspot.

&#x200B;

It's clearest to see what is happening with the phones. You hit the hotspot, it goes into ""Obtaining IP address"" and sits there.

&#x200B;

After 3-4 minutes, it returns an error: ""IP Configuration Failure""

&#x200B;

I've spent hours on the phone with both Comcast Live Chat and Phone Support and it has been extremely disappointing.

&#x200B;

Even though I kept telling the rep that I am nowhere near home, the she kept sending signals to my home modem to see if it would fix the problem.

&#x200B;

And when that didn't work, she told me that there are too many people trying to connect to the hotspot, this is why it's not working.

&#x200B;

She didn't seem to understand that it was working perfectly for 2 months and suddenly stopped working. Kept blaming it on my equipment or ""too many people trying to connect.""

&#x200B;

All the other xfinitywifi hotspots around town work just fine -- it's just this specific one on West Preston St in Baltimore.

&#x200B;

And again - it's only been the past week. Before that, it worked perfectly!

&#x200B;

Now I've been on Twitter with @ComcastCares and I'm getting the runaround: ""No, we can't remotely reboot it."" ... ""It must be an inaccessible hotspot."" ... ""I just checked the node activity at that location and nothing is showing up as a problem. ""

&#x200B;

So wait - your equipment shows there's no problem, so I must be nuts? Why would I waste hours of my life trying to get you to fix a problem that isn't a problem?

&#x200B;

Who is manning this Twitter account? Have they had any customer service training at all? Empathy with the customer is half the battle!

&#x200B;

Why does no one seem to care? Spoken to three different reps now - I've literally wasted my whole Saturday on this garbage.

&#x200B;

I wish I could move on, but I'll be *LIVING HERE FOR (at least) THE NEXT 30 DAYS* with a perfectly broken wifi hotspot!

"Roku express as a replacement box - will it work away from home?Long story short, Im living in two places right now.  Im working far away from my house, so I made an arrangement to stay there during the week, and then I go home for the weekends/days off.

I pay for comcast at home.  I have a few channels, and also HBO and a few others.  The place Im staying has no cable, so I've been using my chromecast to stream netflix.

Ive read about using a roku as a set top box replacement in home.  I was planning on eventually adding this to the TV in the spare bedroom, but it also got me thinking - what would happen if I took that roku (registered to my account), and brought it to my weekday place?  Would it still work normally?  Or is there some restriction where you need to be in the same house?

Finally, if there is some restriction, could it be solved by using a vpn/vps to fool the box so it thinks its on the same network?  

Not a huge deal either way, but when away I miss just putting on some garbage TV in the background.  With netflix its just not the same.  I wish there was a ""put some crappy show on where I dont have to pay attention"" channel.

Thanks.  Lemme know what ya'll think.  ",Comcast

"Comcast AD Injection Into http websiteToday, while browsing [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CayleyGraph.html](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/CayleyGraph.html)  (for programming) I got a pop up ad stating that my modem is old, and I  could upgrade to a comcast modem to get better speeds. Wolfram is a  completely ad free website...

This means:

1. comcast did packet analysis on my traffic.
2. determined the content was a website
3. injected their own ad

Edit: I have been corrected, they actually just use a DNS proxy to give the new website with the ad. still slimy.

This is literally a man in the middle attack coming from my ISP. This is infuriating and should be illegal.

Not  only did this happen, but when calling comcast support to request these  types of ads not to be pushed to me, I was told by level 2 support that  ""We dont push messages to users unless your modem is end of life, and  even then it wont be pushed by website ads"".

"Random internet outages, possibly issues with connection between modem and ISP terminalI have been having random internet outages about once or twice a day the entire 2 years I have been living in my current home with my comcast internet. Initially I just blamed a poor network setup (using powerline adapters and crappy wifi) but then I installed a proper wired network and I continued to have the same issue. I then looked into my modem which it turned out had lots of amazon reviews indicating the same problem so I replaced that with a Netgear CM700. That did not improve the situation with daily outages lasting upwards of 10 minutes still occurring. The new modem does keep a much more detailed log though. Typically T3 timeouts but I have attached the most recent log file. The last thing I did was eliminate all splitters from the path, directly connecting the modem to the line that comes form the box outside. This initially seemed to help but it seems that was just a coincidence since it has since been acting up again. I would also like to be able to use splitters so that cable TV would be an option as well. I live in a townhouse, second farthest unit from the terminal at the end of the building. The cable passes through the other unit's attics before getting to mine so replacing the cable may be complicated...

What can I do about this? I'm assuming I am going to have to have a technician come look at it. Will they hassle me over having my own modem instead of renting theirs? The problem is really intermittent so is there anything specific I should be telling them or data I should be saving so they don't come here and find nothing? What would repairs of such an issue be likely to cost?

"Comcast is going to lose my neighborhood to ATT soon, thankfully.A screenshot of my support calls for internet service outages. My wife works from home and because of Comcast terrible service, we've had to purchase a secondary (dsl through ATT) service just so she has a backup...

We've been here a year and deal with 3-6 outages a month at least. Most of them have no explanation and last 4-6 hours.

Luckily for us, ATT is dropping fiber on the main street in front of our neighborhood and they already have 100mb down there and are moving towards us. If nothing changes, we're definitely switching and I've begun leaving the link to check the speed from ATT for neighbors and friends in the area so they can switch as well.

Comcast will compensate us by giving us a few bucks back for the day but I don't need the money, I need the service I pay a hundred dollars for every month.

"This shouldn’t even be an issueThe only things connected to my modem that are actively using the internet are an Apple TV that’s streaming a movie, a single phone that’s browsing social media, and a PS4 that’s hooked up via an Ethernet (the Ethernet btw is connected wirelessly, and yes, I made sure that wasn’t the actual issue). 

I just spent more than an hour slogging through a mission with three friends only to get disconnected at the very end (final boss killed as well). 

I understand that my PS4 isn’t in the same room, but this happens way more than it needs to be. My modem does this even when I’m just on my phone in my room. It seems that if there’s even the slightest bit of activity from another device, the internet will go from consistently smooth to dead for a minute or more.

Hook one part to the modem and the other to a device. They connect to each other in a closed system (literally set it up by just plugging both into separate outlets and plugging in the Ethernet cables, nothing else). Realistically (I assume at least) the modem is only talking to one device, but that device is talking to another that’s talking to the console.

Also, this has happened a bunch before I got this thing (only had it for a month, even less than, and this is the first it’s happened). Tried connecting to WiFi and the connection does the same thing, only slower internet. WiFi in my room is about 10Mbps, the Ethernet bumps into the 30Mbps range, maybe even more than that.

Stream tv is infinitely better than comcast linear channels on the boxI figured out what bitrate is needed for each resolution NBA tv was at 3.5 mbps. Which is equal to 1080p resolution. I know the box is higher bitrate it's at 6k but here's the thing comcast down rezes the resolution to 720p60 so bit rate doesn't matter only is comcast box connection is more stable and streaming there will be drops but it's worth it overall for a better quality picture it definitely looks clearer. One of the sd channels was at 1.5 mbps which is 720p quality. Only thing stream tv has it in a black border but pq is definetly better than box. That's my studying for the day.

I live in South Florida. I actually worked for Comcast in 2010, for about a year. What I say about that experience is, ""Remember when Han Solo cut open the bantam on Hoth? He said ... 'I thought these things smelled bad ... on the OUTSIDE.'""

&#x200B;

Because when you work for Comcast, you can completely understand why everyone hates it. I remember an office poster with this guy and it said, ""We're listening!"" The guy had a constipated look on his face ... he's listening so hard. In actual, fact, what they do is hear you, but never, ever listen to you. One of the things they do is give employees free cable, internet, etc., so that you can actually work there without hating Comcast too much.

&#x200B;

I do not know if I was fired or quit. Eight years later, and about two weeks ago, the internet starts getting real spotty, and it's time to for my annual call. That is their thing. ""We'll make it better"" ... but it will never work without me having to call. That's the part I hate the most, is that they think it is normal to have to call them about once a year or so to fix their sh\*t.

&#x200B;

Add this to the normal stuff that comes with Comcast. I do not know about ATT, to which I switched. But Comcast is about 50% commercials. I am old enough to remember when I was monetized only once. We got TV for free, and the commercials WERE the monetization. Comcast's brilliant strategy was to charge on top of that, monetizing twice. They're actually going to sell browsing history, which will monetize everyone three times.

&#x200B;

Add to this, the programming itself is just garbage. What the hell is ""Cake Boss""? Do I even want to click on that to answer my own question? (no). What's this, ""Baking in Britain?"" These last few months, looking at the programming, taking about ten or fifteen minutes to find anything, I realized that I really just wanted out.

"Reoccurring issues with XfinityFor over a month now my family has been experiencing substantial issues with our internet connection. We've had Xfinity for a very long time, back when they were still under the name of Comcast. Even back then, we had minor issues. This, however, takes the cake.

Consistently our internet is completely shut off. Wifi and direct line both are shut at a random point in the afternoon, almost always right after 3 PM, but today it was about 1:45 PM. I'm on 4G right now, so I can write this. The internet is still experiencing issues.

We called Xfinity about it yesterday, and their explanation is that the router/hardware they gave us is no longer used, and that they would get us a new one Friday. This is odd, because we got this new one this year, not even 6 months ago.

Now, I'm not making any major claims. I had some people say it's throttling now that NN is gone. I had others say it's like what Xfinity says, a hardware issue. But why is it doing it now and not when we got the new router?

"Bait and switch?I was wandering around Best Buy in Union City when a Comcast guy approaches me and says he can save me about $40 a month on my bill if I agree to the installation of a digital box/recorder, a home security system, and lock me into a 2 year contract if I pay them $99.  I kept asking what the catch was.  So I do it, an installer does the install and then a week or so later I notice my old movie channels aren't there.  I come to find out he changed my service to a cheap Latino package, with reduce services, and I don't remotely look Mexican.

So I get my original service back and then today I come to find my bill is actually higher and I had to pay $99 for that privilege.  I managed to get them to refund the $99.

However, what ever happened to the several month intro rate discount they'd give you when they screw up?  I've been paying $220 a month for years.  Ridiculous for TV with commercials on nearly every channel.  I don't get showtime, hbo, cinimax, etc.

Getting my $99 back for having to pay a higher rate is one thing.  After that I was put through to the customer loyalty department expecting to get some intro rate for a few months which occurred to me many years ago when I had my cable disconnected due to their mistake.  I was conned with a pure bait and switch(latino package) and all the loyalty guy would do was to cut my rate by a trivial $18 by taking away a few services.  No discount.

I figured it's just Comcast being Comcast, because as we all know, the one thing Comcast is good at is being absolutely fucking worthless, and I assumed it'd fix itself by this morning.

Well it didn't. So I reset my router since occasionally I have to do that when this happens. Sure enough, that didn't do a thing. I am doing some homework online and had to download a 65 mb file. You know how long that took? 8 minutes. 8 goddamn fucking minutes for a file that would usually take seconds.

So we signed up on the 19th of august this month by the 19th I got a warning that we exceeded the data cap. What data cap never had one before?

I've tried resetting everything on my laptop, cycling power on the router (brand new comcast gigabit modem/router), and even cycling power to my entire house to see if something else on the network was bogging it down.

I went to check the connection and notice the modem’s lights keep looking like it’s restarting, then after a few minutes it’s fixed, then it starts over.

It did this for about an hour or two, now it’s not resetting itself anymore but my power line adapter still isn’t working correctly.

For reference I have a Linksys CM3008 and some linksys router as well (it was a combo pack that included a separate router, modem, and WiFi booster fwiw).

"Comcast RegretTLDR at bottom.

I moved into a new apartment in March that offered comcast internet and TV services. At the time I was able to get the basic package with HBO and an Internet boost included. Was still pricey, and I was bummed because some channels I was used to on my previous basic plan were not included (local sports channel for baseball, had it at my previous apartment on comcast basic), but overall was fine with it.

On Septmeber 4th I was called about upgrading. They said I would be able to keep my internet boost, and get more channels for $20 more a month. I was told I'd get a 30 day window to switch back to my old plan. Made sure to ask if I would keep my boost and get HBO back (not included in upgrade, but didn't use it that much) if I went back. It was all ""Yes yes yes"" and then reiterating how all the men needed their sports and how great a deal this was. Was also told there would be no other charges, after I asked.

I checked my bill a few days ago and saw an $18 charge for the internet boost and a $25 service charge. Didn't think it was that big of a deal, but it was not what I was told. I planned on canceling anyways, I dont watch the sports channels enough.

I called today to cancel and was informed that I could not go back to my previous plan, as it stop being offered in July. People still have it who are grandfathered in, but they dont offer it. I waited for the agent to discuss the situation with her manager and received the received special approval. My bill will be the same a previously, with the same basic channels, but I lose my speed boost and HBO. They had to pull strings, and I still lose out on $30+ of services. I was obviously frustrated, but I know it wasn't the agents fault- they did a good job. The agent filed a complaint for me, but I was wondering if their was anything else I could do?

Last night I was not so kindly informed that I could not connect to the internet because they red-flagged my address for too many accounts over the years, some of which didn’t pay their bills (do you not know how rental properties work you dipshits?!). I was told that my internet was disconnected, my address was flagged, and my account cancelled/closed, and in order to get it restored, I need to go to one of their brick and mortar stores with my social security card, state ID, and proof of residency.

"Hello, having major home internet issue  

Hello, I seem to have a weird internet connection problem with my home network. In my home the internet connection seems to be weak for all computers in most parts of the house except the basement room where the router is. The router is connected to a computer through Ethernet cable, and this computer seems to have the best and most stable connection of all. Above basement level the laptops and also the mac have connections that are feint or slow and aren't using an Ethernet cable. Even our cell phones that are connected to the home network have a feint or slow connection. 

Connection for entire house only seems stable when right after calling Comcast and having them send a surge or whatever to my house, but its only temporary.

I know its not a hardware issue on the laptops part because when I took my laptop to a hotel in ocean city it worked fine with the hotel WiFi, but at my home it doesn’t have as strong as connection as my computer that is directly connected to the router in the basement.

I was wondering how to solve this and what could be the problem. I want all the computers/laptops/phones connected to our home comcast  network to have good stable connection but it seems only the computer connected to the router with an ethernet cable has good stable connection.

Could it be because the router is really old? It’s like 10 yrs. old.",Comcast
"Intermittent internet connection issuesHello all,

I've been having this problem for about a month and a half, have had three service technicians and four different modems. I have spent over 10 hours on the phone with netgear and comcast and the issue has still not been solved. I am frustrated and all out of options as it seems no one wants to help, hopefully I can get some advice here.

I am experiencing small intermittent drops in my internet which are extremely noticeable when gaming or watching a stream. When a technician comes to the house they say nothing is wrong because I am getting the speeds. It is impossible for them to detect these drops with their tiny Ipads. I have ran ping test recently and see that the request timed out multiple times through the test. These drops happen about every 15 minutes or so. The drops will throw me out of a game and cut my connection completely for a very short interval of time.

To recap, I only receive these drops when gaming, streaming, or using discord.  Which is everything I do. These drops happen throughout the entire day, non-time specific. Could this be a firewall issue? Comcast seems to not wanna come and inspect the lines, even though I have asked multiple times.

&#x200B;

I recently decided to get cable, primarily for sports viewing.  I already had xfinity for internet, but had a digital antenna for my network TV.  Even on my 4K TV, over the air picture quality was decent.  (My understanding is most air broadcasting is in 720p, which my TV likely upscaled internally.)  For the record, TV is a 55"" Samsung curved 4k something something.

I hooked up my new box last night (all connections secure, only one splitter, short runs with both coax and hdmis), and the picture quality is abysmal.  Movement is jerky, picture is highly pixelated across all HD channels.  I switched the output on my box (xg2v2) to 1080p, and it did basically nothing.  I messed with my TV settings and it's still awful.

I've done research and have seen two major schools of thought.  (1) Some people say comcast is overcompressing or something like that, and that there is no hope for improvement.  (2) Others say that some of the  boxes from the previous generation did a better job of transmitting pictures that were at least acceptable for viewing on a 4k TV.

"I dislike Comcast as much as anyone else, but yesterday, I had a positive experience with Tech SupportMy internet connection went down at 2pm.  TV and phone were fine.

That did not fix it.

I called 800-COMCAST.  I tried the automated system to send a reset to the modem.  The voice said it could take as much as 10 minutes to work.  It asked it it could send me an SMS TXT to confirm that it had worked. I set up a repeating ping 4.2.2.4 so that I could see when it reconnected.

About 5 minutes later, it reconnected.  Hurray!  about 5 minutes later, Comcast TXT asking if it was working.  I replied SUCCESS.  1 minute later, it went down again, so I TXT FAILURE.  They TXT asking if they could call me to further resolve the problem.  I replied YES, and within 1 minute, they called and connected me with a Technician.

I explained to the Tech what had happened so far.  He did quick diagnostics, then send a RESET signal to my modem.  Within 5 minutes of that, it came back online, and has been fine ever since.

My computer MUST be ""top of the line, i6 or better"" to get an accurate speed test. 3. 300mbps is ""fast enough""Wow....Just....Just wow....What a day I've had. I am honestly proud of myself that I didn't lose it.  Here's my story. I'm sure I'll fit in here.

I've had the gig package since February, no problems whatsoever until about 3 weeks ago when my speed dropped down to 150-250mbps. I chatted with Comcast and set up a technician to come out Thursday, however, when I got the confirmation email it said Sunday....No biggie I says to myself, I'll just reschedule. Only available date is Saturday...Okie dokie, I can do Saturday. So I set my time for Saturday between 2 and 4. 11:30 this morning a technician knocks on my door.....No problem, the house is clean, no time better than the present. 

This is when stuff really goes sideways. 

I invite the technician in and notice he has a modem in his hand. ""Oh, I purchased my own modem."" Then I get that blank stare.....Technician does not speak a word of English...I mean not a word....""No problem"" I say to myself again, my wife is fluent in Spanish. She comes out and translates for us. He was told this was an install but he can troubleshoot for me to see if he can fix the problem. He logs into my wifi, runs a speed test, gets 200mbps. He's then trying to log into the modem backend to check the diagnostics, the only problem is, the modem isn't wifi (Motorola MB8600) capable and I use google wifi which doesn't have port forwarding set up.. He's trying to figure out what to do next so I have my wife tell him I'll get my laptop and plug directly into the modem for him. So I grab my laptop and log into the modem willy nilly. He looked at the connection status and says everything looks good. Then, he just stares at me waiting for me to say ""sure, go ahead and leave"" 

I asked him next if there was anything he though might need to be done outside because the chat session rep said my lines were probably too old (8 year old house) and needed to be upgraded to fiber optic lines, to which he replied ""I don't know"" and continued to stare. I asked if he'd call his supervisor for me. He calls his supervisor who then proceeded to tell me that my modem was the problem because it was not a ""Comcast owned modem"" and that it could be my computer because it probably wasn't fast enough to get an accurate test ....My 2 month old i7-8700 laptop.......Also, that it had to be at least an ""i6 or higher"" (a processor that doesn't exist) and peppered in a ""300mbps is fast enough for most people""

At this point it's obvious nothing is going to get fixed and this dude is saying whatever he can to get me off the phone. So I tell the supervisor  ""I understand there is only so much you can do, but your answer is unacceptable. I'm going to move this up the chain, are you sure that your answer is what you want me explaining to the next tier?"" He's quiet for a few seconds then says ""I'll have the tech check the signal strength.""....""Perfect"" I replied, thanked him and handed the phone back to the tech. My wife is translating that his supervisor told him to test the signal with some tool which the tech said he didn't bring with him because this was just an installation. He went outside for 45 minutes and came back in and said he couldn't fix it, shook my hand and left. 


Isn't it sad that I'm actually relieved that at the end of a service call, I still have 1/3 of the speed I pay for each month, instead of no internet?

"Paying for 150Mbps Internet in new Apartment, but barely reaches outside of living room, let alone upstairs.Hi all,

Recently moved into a new two-floor apartment, in which we have the 2nd and 3rd floors of a house. The house is older and the wiring isn't great overall, but we've just had a Comcast tech come and change the cable to be XFinity, as well as install a router.

The issue is, the WiFi isn't even picked up on the 3rd floor whatsoever, and is incredibly weak outside of the living room.

What options do we have? With Verizon at my old place, they gave us a free Netgear router to extend the signal upstairs, however according to Comcast chat support, they ""don't deal in extenders"".

We can't run an ethernet cord upstairs as it would be a massive nuisance with the way the floor plan is laid out (staircase upstairs is small and on other side of apartment, living room is down a turning-hall way, so no straight shot for a cord).

"Intermittent Outbound Packet LossSo I'm throwing myself upon the mercy of the r/Comcast community to try and get some help.

&#x200B;

**So a summary of my issue:**

I've had service at my current address for the past 2-3 years. For the past 3-4 weeks, I've been experiencing intermittent outbound packet loss, primarily between 9pm and 6am EDT when it's almost constant, but the issue happens throughout the day at random intervals. Spikes of up to 40% packet loss are fairly common; with the average loss over a sustained period of time being closer to 5-10% (spikes to 20-40%, then falls and maintains at 3-5% for a period of time). This is also accompanied by service degradation on a gigabit service to speeds of around 100-150Mbps down, and as little as 3 Mbps up while testing from the xfinity website. It's worth noting that I'm using PingPlotter to monitor the traceroute and latency, and the issue is between me and the first node on the network for sure. I've verified this via testing from remote PC's tracerouting back to my own modem as well. I also don't experience significantly increased latency during the periods of packet loss; however I do experience severely decreased speeds in addition to the packet loss.

**Steps I've already taken:**

Basic Modem 101's (restart, replace, etc, etc) - I have the CGM4140COM currently, which is the 2nd modem I've experienced the issue with

I've always been hard-wired

Ensured signal strength from the modem is within spec

Contacted support numerous times, with about as much luck as you expect

Had 3 techs out; who have not had the good fortune to be here while my connection is being terrible and one of whom seems to think it may be a plant issue, but unless someone higher than them pushes say nothing will happen.

Disconnected every device connected to the modem, leaving only a single laptop running some monitoring. Issue persisted.

&#x200B;

 **What I need to know:** 

What do I do? Who the hell can I try to contact? I'm at wits end trying to do everything I can think of to get the issue resolved. At this point, I can only assume it's some form of ingress causing hell with my connection. But I'll be damned if there's anything I can do about it. Below is a snapshot of what my connection looks like on the average evening. As someone who is an avid gamer and utilized VOIP on a daily basis, this is pretty crippling to my hobbies. Anyone have any ideas or advice?

"Business account - considering ditching the rented equipment and getting our own modem & router. Can we talk about the pros/cons of this? (also posted in /r/Comcast_Xfinity) 

Our company is considering the possibility of getting rid of the rented equipment we are paying for at $14.95/month and getting our own modem and router instead. It seems there are a variety of pros and cons to this. Here are some that I've come across:

\-Owning Con: No more tech support & Comcast can claim that our equipment is causing problems should they arise

\-Renting Con: Comcast can throttle speeds by sending a code to the equipment

\-Renting Pro: We can get a free annual equipment upgrade (though this equipment may still be inferior to purchased equipment - right?)

\-Owning Pro: We will save money over the long run

"Outage RageSo, had an outage of my Comcast Business Internet this afternoon.  The building power went out briefly at the same time, so I strongly suspected some outside failure - backhoe, car crashing into a pole, etc.  Modem came back up but without the connection lights.  Called in to report the outage, went through the phone tree, including no less than 4 minutes' worth of shouting ""NO!"" at ""You have a past due of $$$"" prompts that I totally didn't care about - that's Accounts Payable, not IT.  I eventually get on with an agent, report the problem, reset my modem again just to comply with their script, etc.  The agent was in the middle of scheduling a tech call-out when it came up on her screen that my problem was due to a larger outage (as expected).

So far, no problem - it's annoying, but it happens when you've got physical infrastructure exposed to the crazy public.

So, the agent gets to the point in the script that I was actually calling about - getting my phone into their system so I can receive updates as the problem is resolved.  The agent takes my number and gives a little spiel about possible data charges for SMS, etc.  Everything sounded good.

Except I never got any update.  Some time passed and eventually it came back up.  Not a single update, not even a ""it's fixed"" message.

At no point was I able to keep management in the loop about possible timing - this was of course affecting business for the day and management (reasonably) wanted if not an immediate fix, at least some possible estimates.  And I was unable to give them anything.

This is the fourth outage in the past year and a half, which in terms of uptime actually isn't too bad.  And outages are always going to occur as long as we're dealing with public infrastructure.  And, in this case, it was only down for an hour or so, which is worth giving props for being on top of things.

But in every case, no updates.  One of the previous outages was over 16 hours, and at no point did we have any indication of whether it was going to be another 5 minutes or several days.  Which of course made for some pissy managers unable to plan for the day and without the information that they need on whether they need to make alternate plans.

Seriously Comcast?  You have a system in place for this.  You keep close tracking of your dispatch techs every step of the way so they can barely hit the restroom without it being logged.  And you claim that the customer can get in on that tracking as well.  Except that it just plain never works.

Random service outages are one thing, but failing on your own promised communication methods is simply unacceptable.

This latest outage has prompted some management-level interest in researching redundant internet connections.  I fully expect that we can get a better deal on our redundant line and be able to drop our Comcast service down to a lower speed/priced package and consider Comcast to tbe our backup instead of our primary.",Comcast

Best they could offer was to go a la carte and I lose phone (no biggy) all Movie Channels  and my new bill only went down to $228.20 which is still $10 more then I paid before the promotion ended.

I live in a rural area and the cable from outside the house would be about 100' to 150'. From the basement to the upstairs office would require another 150' or so of cable. I'm trying to do a little preemptive research on this and read that there is signal degradation the longer the RG6 line is. I couldn't find anything out about signal degradation over CAT6 though.

My question is, should I run about 150' of RG6 cable from the basement to the modem/router upstairs in the office or should I have the modem in the basement and then run 150' of CAT6 to the router upstairs. Would the latter provide a stronger signal? Sorry if this sounds dumb. I'm just trying to figure this out before buying cables. Thank you!",Comcast
"Comcast has gotten screwing customers down to a science.TL;DR - When Comcast surprises you with a rate increase, they carefully collect data on what surprise price increase will result in cancelations vs just complaints. Screwing customers is an integral, well thought out part of their strategy.

I signed up in August last year for 100 Mbps @ $39.99 (internet service only). In January I get an email saying:

""Hold on tight. We've increased your Internet speed. We're on a mission to improve your experience, and that means making sure you have the Internet speeds you need to save time and do more of what you love. That's why we've increased your speed from 100 Mbps to 150 Mbps **at no extra cost to you**. So, go ahead – simply restart your modem to enjoy your new speed."" (bolded by me for emphasis)

August rolls around and my bill goes up to $54.99, and sure enough, they are charging me $39.99 plus $14.99 for the speed boost. I call to ask why the price went up when they said it would be at no cost to me, and the rep says that I signed up in August for the Performance Pro package when I initiated service and refused to remove the charge. Honestly, I felt bad for the poor call center rep that is being incentivized to basically lie to people, so I made a point of being polite at all times. It took me quoting the original confirmation email, then the January email, before she gave up on that story and switched to trying to find another promotion I could sign up for, saying she can do 60 Mbps @ $39.99 plus I get a month of some streaming service.

I get that for some people, it's worth playing these games every once in a while to get fast internet at as low a price as possible. That's just not the case for me - so I canceled the service and switched to Sonic DSL, where I'm paying $39.99 for 20Mbps, because honestly, having to figure out how Comcast is going to screw me and keep on top of that is more than I care to deal with. Have always had great experiences with Sonic in the past and am willing to take the speed hit not to have to deal with Comcast. Maybe if AT&T Fiber expands to my area I'll roll the dice on that.

Comcast then hits me with an automated survey through three different channels where the first option given for why you canceled (after they figure out that you didn't move) is:

""The monthly fee on your service was increasing or has increased.""

When you select that, the next question is:

""What was the amount of the monthly increase?""

So basically they are testing out what level of price increase they can get away with, and using the ""Customer Satisfaction"" survey to do that. I didn't even have a particularly horrible experience from a customer service perspective - the big realization for me was that misleading and mistreating customers is actually an integral part of how Comcast does business. It's not just bad PR, or bad support - they take a zero sum view towards their customers, and are scientific in their approach to screwing you over. There are dozens, if not hundreds of people at Comcast who explicitly designed and executed this strategy, and thousands more who know about it and are complicit. This is the danger of monopoly power, and unchecked corporate greed.",Comcast

"4k Set-top flakey HDMI/power issues and incorrect colors (w/Amazon 4k FireTV)Got a 4k tv so i figured why not get the 4k box from comcast. setup was ok, except there is no power button on the box (more on that later because I want to un-pair it from controlling the TV).

The power issue stems from where I have to talk to the stb to get it to power down. I allowed it to control my TV, and now it just turns off he tv and sits there. Usual power up sequence involves the TV looking for input in hdmi1, and then it says nothing is there. Remedy is unplugging and plugging hdmi. this is not a good solution moving forward.

"One call, 4 different answersIn July, after my bill doubled at the end of the contract, I discontinued the TV service and reduced my speed to 60mbs (from 150). I opted for the no-games ""just give me a price without surprises"" option of 60mbs for 66.95/mo. Fast forward to this week, I got a promo listing that speed + TV for $49.95, so I checked online to see the offers (competitor fiber is a year away for my neighborhood).

Online, it shows that my current service (unspecified) is $84/mo. So I call (after Googling their contact number, since they make it hard to find). I'm told that I have 150mbs service. I explain I signed up for the 60mbs service and I'm told, ""no you are on 150mbs plan."" I press the point and am told, I'm on the 150 plan with customer retention discount. I counter that I am not even getting half of that (did Speedtest.net while on the phone). Then I'm told I've got the 75mbs plan (not even listed on their site). We go back and forth some more, I ask to speak with a supervisor or manager, I get the runaround, we go back and forth and I again press to speak with a manager (not taking no for an answer).

Manager comes on and tells me I'm on the 65mbs plan with customer retention discount. I ask for price confirmation and whether it's a limited-time promo or a regular price I can count on. Manager confirms it's not a promo, but a regular rate. So, after nearly 30 minutes, I did at least confirm something I thought I already knew before I called, at least there's that...

I thought I might upgrade, including buying a new modem, since they say that I may not get full speeds with my existing one (never had problems before, but maybe that's why 60bms — er, 65mbs — feels much slower than that and latency is high). Before dealing with them online and by phone, I was 90% decided to get a new cable modem, but now I wonder if I should just switch to Sonic Internet, since I've heard good things about them, even though they only offer up to 30mbs in my area (4,200 feet from CO). I shudder at moving back to DSL, but Comcast is just so frustrating to deal with — they don't even put the speed of the internet I'm paying for on the bills. I also detest their anti-competitive practices, the way they give their existing customers worse deals than new customers and on and on.

Saturday rolls around and we are still having internet problems.  The tech shows up during his time frame and immediately gets to work.  He verifies the abnormally high upstream readings, then proceeds to remove a couple splitters that weren't being used.  Unfortunately this doesn't do anything so he goes outside to check the line.  He finds a line that was marked by Comcast a couple weeks ago for causing interference with the other lines in the area.

Before this I had better plan for previous 1y called ""Performance Plus"" (60Mbps) and  when today I went to xfinity.com to check offers and prices they offer  ""Performance Plus"" for $29.99/m, but when I called Comcast asking if I can switch to it (and renew contract, which I they used to do few times in the  past with no problem as that keeps customers treated fairly and keeps/RETAINS them), now they tell me that for existing  customers they only offer $44.99/m for ""Performance Plus"" and this  $29.99/m is only for ""off the street"" new/stranger customers. This was confirmed by manager/supervisor too multiple times while talking to ""customer retention department"". So, I expressed my  dissatisfaction with such practice stating that I see this as DISCRIMINATION against me as a current customer over the new customers and stated that then their department now should not be called ""retention"" but ""deterrent"" as that is the ultimate outcome. In the light of this, I wanted to leave but they remind me that I am ""hooked"" and would  need to pay ""early termination fee"" $10/m (which would translate to \~11  months). They said that is what contract has written (although these contracts are overly long and not written to be understood in detail by anybody who is not lawyer. All in all, on paper company can write any gaming scheme that is not ultimately fair and we as customers would have to fight for fairness (remind them what retention and fairness means, to treat existing customers better or at minimum equal as outside/new customers and remind them that this applies universally to every collective from family to company to state to humankind and wider).

I see this practice of ""big companies"" behaviour as quite dishonest and ""playing with small-print games"", ultimately all rigged against interests  of us customers creating very unhealthy market where all customers are  subjects for manipulation and rip off's bit by bit.

I already filed BBB report and will follow with it.

"Inconsistent Fast Forwarding Speeds?Does anyone else have issues with inconsistent fast forwarding speeds on recorded shows? For example, I’m watching a recorded SVU and when I tried fast forwarding (2x), it did fine through a couple of commercials, and then it took nearly a minute for it to “fast forward” through a single commercial. Hitting the fast forward button one more time jumped ahead another five minutes in the recording...

I get the feeling that we’re “allowed” to fast forward in a limited fashion... but once you try to get through too much, they throttle the fast forwarding speed to make it more convenient to simply watch the commercials than to fast forward them. Maybe I’m just paranoid. Also searched this on Google and couldn’t find any relevant info...",Comcast

"New Customer Confused about the Starz Channel. Does it also include Starz Encore? I was told NO by a Cust Serv Sup, but I can watch it on the Roku on a 2nd TV.Hello,
I'm a brand new customer of Comcast (of only 2 weeks) and have a question. I recently changed from a ""Quad Play"" to a ""Double Play"" pkg on 8/31 that now includes/adds Starz free for 2 years that I did not have before. Does that include Starz Encore as well? I was told by a customer service supervisor that the Starz TV pkg does NOT include any Starz Encore channels. It's only included in a higher TV pkg (I have the 140 channel pkg).

The weird part is that when I filter my DVR on my main TV to show ""Free to Me,"" (in other words the guide ONLY shows channels that I am subscribing to/paying for), but when I view the guide, it shows the Starz channels AND Starz Encore listed. 

In addition, I CAN watch ALL the On Demand for Starz Encore, but just can't watch any Starz Encore channels on live TV on the main DVR cable box. Why is that? 

On top of that, I use the Stream app thru a Roku for a 2nd TV, and I CAN watch Starz Encore on this TV (live TV) and also all the On Demand. I just can't watch Starz Encore live on the main DVR box.

Does Starz include Starz Encore as well? If not, why am I am able to watch the Starz Encore On Demand  on both TV's AND live Starz Encore channels on the Roku App? Could there be an error on the back end when I switched pkgs and added Starz? Can someone definitely explain what's gong on? Thank you.

"Comcast has been a nightmare to deal with so far.I’m currently in the process of moving and wanted to switch ISP. I had ATT for 8 years and felt it was the right time to move on. I called Comcast around August of 15th to schedule for wifi, cable, and xfinity home on August 24. When the technician came, he said that because my area is new the wires aren’t fully activated until August 30th and so I have to reschedule. Okay, fair enough I’ll wait another week if i means I get better internet and cable. So I scheduled for September 4th. Today, I called back to add 2 security cameras to the package. Everything went smoothly until I hung up the phone. I got a notification from xfinity saying my appointment had been changed again to September 13. This was done without me knowing and my consent. I’ve been trying to call back and get an explanation for the last 4 hours and all they could tell me was “we’re sorry, we can’t do anything so deal with it.” For a first time customer this whole experience has been incredibly frustrating.

"xfinity bridge mode packet lossBackground:
I have my own router.  Running double NAT resulted into the youngest not being able to allow people to connect to his minecraft game.  Our download speed was also less than half.

This morning, I set the comcast router to bridge mode and it was working fine for a while, but tonight, started getting about a 33% packet loss.

I switched the comcast modem back to router mode and the packet loss went away.

Next, I put our router in the Comcast DMZ and the speed is back to full speed.

2 Questions:

What could have caused the packet loss when in bridge mode?

Putting it in the DMZ seems to work fine.  Are there any potential issues with having it in the DMZ as opposed to using bridge mode?

Note: at this point, I'm planning on just keeping it in the DMZ on the Comcast router.

"Comcast Mobile, Rep Lied.So I found out I could Get Mobile from comcast. When and checked it out.

Messaged chat, Was told if I drop my phone that my Internet would be on promotion for $71.99I Told the rep thatwouldnt work, since thats more then my current package for Internet and Phone, Was insured when I called retention that they would give me a better deal something around 39,99-49,99 so with that I placed the order for a new cell phone.

Called today to cancel my land line, Was told the best they could do was that $71.99 and I told them about the chat I had with the rep.

While on the phone I could her the rep typing like crazy while she claimed to be reading the chat message between me and the Mobile sales rep, they then told me that the only conversation I had was with a different rep on the 26th... which I did have about them sending the  Wrong color phone.

I tried to explain to them, why would I agree to cancel my home phone so my Internet could go up, that makes no sense. The worst part is the town I live in is only serviced by Comcast for internet.

So I proceed to tell them I will be sending the phone back, A 1000 dollar purchase, I will be disconnecting both the phone and Internet, and My room mate goes to college and will just get the Internet, for the introduction price of $39.99 for 2 years.

They went on to claim that would be fraud, And I explained nicely what their mobile rep did was bait and switch. He promised me another price, that would be lower then the $71.

So Now how can I get comcast to send me a copy of that chat? Must I send in a written request?

Also how can it be fraud, i I am dis happy with the service and my room mate is going to get her own line for college.

I mean, how can they refuse my room mate service, just because she lives at the same address and is sub leasing. Can they do that?

Also the rep promising me that retention had better deals he doesnt have access too, was the only reason I got the phone, I explained in detail my plans.

"Potential New Comcast Customer - What do you REALLY pay monthly?Hey all, I've had AT&T (now uverse) internet for a long time, ~20 years or so and they haven't kept up with internet speeds in my area (Central California). Comcast offers insane speeds versus AT&T's 45Mbps (the pain). I'm thinking of getting the 150Mbps for $44.99/mo.

But there are all the fees we don't see until the bill comes. I know we're going to get screwed by them. I'd just rather be prepared.

Can you give me an estimate of what we will really pay. 

Right now for our 45Mbps we pay $86.

"What just happened to my service?!Hello,

I can 100% confirm that my service was working 24 hours ago - actually less than that because of when I left for work in the morning. Sometime between me leaving for work and noon, service dropped - without explanation. My parents we're home all day and got the screen shot below - what causes this?! 

My mother spoke with 'tech support' twice. I was told they sent something to reboot the router and give it 10 minutes (why the tech hung up without resolution is another question). Over the phone I walked her through rebooting the router and can verify it was back up (logging into the router again and seeing the Wifi networks, there's still no WAN address). She then called 'tech support' again and was told Comcast can't communicate with my modem yet she still got this screen attached.

I googled welcome to Xfinity and got nothing of any revelance. I am not aware of any service changes in the area and own the modem. Is there any easy way to fix this without calling 'tech support':?!

"Had cable on my lawn for 3 months, complained to FCC - resolved same dayI got xfinity because there was no other option in my area.

Ordered  it late May around 5/20 and had trouble right away. The connection to  the house wasn't working, so I had to have a tech come out, he missed  his appointment so I got $20 for that (had to call 4 people and  eventually just tweeted to them to get the money).

​

I  HIGHLY recommend dealing with them through Twitter as it's the easiest  and fastest way to get them to respond and you deal with them on your  time not by staying on-hold, however you are not dealing with your local  branch and some distant (probably overseas) customer rep area.

​

So  finally tech comes out and states my underground line is no good, he  will run a temporary line and have work scheduled to put in a permanent  underground line (I recommend underground line as no trees can snap it  and generally it's more weather proof and reliable). Seems there was no  room for my connection on the pole so he disconnected my neighbor, which  we had a good laugh at with my neighbor at how dumb Comcast is.

​

Comcast  charges me $50 install fee despite me plugging in my router/modem  myself, after lengthy tweets they reversed these charges after I showed  them a screenshot where they said I won't be charged.

​

Over  the next 3 months the temporary line is laying on my lawn, I have to  pick it up to mow, the mailman tripped over it. The third party cable  company laid my cable down within the month but never told Comcast. So  for 3 months I tweet Comcast every now and then, finally getting sick of  it I start tweeting and looking for updates daily.

​

Finally  I warn them I will complain to the FCC, and again they apologize but  don't do shit. I give them 3 days and still nothing is done so at work I  file an FCC complaint and submit a 42 page word document with all  Comcast/My tweets. I tell Comcast I have done this, and wish them good  luck. A few hours later they schedule a tech to come out and check the  situation, he comes out snips the temp line and connects underground  line in under 30 minutes. I give him cold water and thank him. DONE. I  tell Comcast the situation is resolved and thank them.

​

For  the last week techs have been coming to see me, I have been getting  calls asking me if I need help, and now a Comcast Exec has left me a  voicemail saying he wants to learn more about my situation. LOL

tl;dr  - Underground lines are better than air lines, tweet at Comcast don't  bother calling them, ask for $20 when a tech doesn't show up, complain  to FCC if Comcast is fucking around.",Comcast

"Ongoing Internet Issues/Comcast Won't Send Out Line CrewSo my current situation:

I have had issues with my blast tier internet speed for the last 7-8 months in my current apartment.  Speeds will get a slow as .5 - 2 Mbps during a speed test.  I'm on the top floor of a 3 story/6 unit building.  Junction box to lines coming from Comcast is on the second floor of the building.  Line into building is elevated so they need a truck with a cherry picker to get up to replace line.

* Every time I call and explain the issue the CS person goes through the usual script and then tell me they need to send out a tech
* Tech examines issues and says, yep, issue with the line and they need to schedule to send a line crew to fix/replace line
* No confirmation of crew every being assigned/sent
* Back to square one

I did get a phone number for corporate Comcast once and spoke with someone who scheduled a line person to come out and do the work.  He then called me and said he needed prior approval from building management to do the work at the building.  Management company called him and gave direct authorization.  Work has still not been completed and speed issues are still ongoing.

I called again about this issue this past Thursday and they again send out a tech on Friday (who was supposed to come with a line tech!) who said the same exact thing the other 4-5 techs they have sent out have said.   No work done and nothing fixed.  Just another waste of my Friday afternoon for nothing to be fixed.

"Currently on basic cable + Internet package- where to go from here?I'm in Western PA and recently found out Gigabit is available in my location. I'm potentially looking at upgrading my Internet speed from the 250 Mbps tier to possibly 400 Mbps or 1 Gbps.

Right now I've only got Limited Basic TV Service 30+ channels ($17.99) and Blast! Internet ($79.95) so after fees and taxes it is $107 with no contract prices or anything.  When I try to pick any plans online it only gives me triple play bundles with higher TV tiers + Internet + phone;  unless I want to pay $299.99 a month for 2 Gbps (which I do not) and that is the only Internet only package being offered.

I absolutely do not want phone service, at all.  So I decided to chat with a Comcast rep online seeing how much it would cost to just upgrade the Internet speed. He told me I had a legacy ""a la carte"" plan and literally the only options available were to do the triple play bundles.  I haven't looked into it further but decided to post here on Reddit.  I'd be open to getting more TV channels if I could do a decent bundle with 250 Mbps / 400 Mbps or 1000 Mbps Internet and that's it.  Or just keep TV the same and upgrade Internet. I remember years ago Comcast offered the ""Double Play"".  Side note, I already have my own Netgear CM1000 that I'm going to use with this service so I also will not be leasing.

What is my best avenue (Xfinity store nearby, phone, chat, etc...) to just upgrade Internet?  Would it be possible to do a ""Double Play"" bundle and only get TV + Internet? ",Comcast

Unfortunately Comcast is my only viable option for internet.  Until recently Centurylink was the only other option, and that was only 7Mbps down/768Kbps up.  Now it's not available anywhere within 1/4 mile of me, any address I put in.  
To add insult to injury, I'm pretty sure it's comcast's fiber running through the right of way strip on the front of my property but I can't get the gigabit pro fiber service because it's insane - $1000 in startup fees and $300 a month on a 2 year contract, despite those fees being waived and/or being $150 in parts of the east coast.  
  
Words cannot express how much I loathe this company, and how desperately I wish anyone would move in to my medium sized city and start providing a viable alternative to comcast for internet so I can cut the damn cable line where it comes up out of the concrete and tell comcast they will never service this address again, at least as long as I live.",Comcast
"Ethernet speed locked at 100mbsJust as the title says, I recently upgraded to a 150mbs plan but the issue is that no matter what I do my download speed stays locked at 90-100mbs when using Ethernet, Wi-Fi is fine however and remains in the 170-175 range.
I've tried anything short of everything that comes to mind, connecting directly to the modem, resetting modem and pc, changing the speed and duplex to 1gb full duplex on my network settings, turning off green Ethernet, updating drivers.... etc

I've spent the past 3 hours playing around with settings and going on forums but nothing's helped so far. If anyone thinks I'm overlooking something then feel free to let me know. Any help is appreciated.

"Have a technician coming over today and I'm looking for advice!I have had a recurring problem for about 2-3 years now where every couple of months or maybe even weeks, a consistent series of micro-disconnections start happening for a time (would last anywhere for days to months, and would happen as consistently as a couple minutes apart to hours).  However up until now I have never scheduled a technician to come by in fear that whenever it Does reappear that a technician would simply swing by and the ""wave"" would have passed where there was nothing but a clear connection by the time the scheduled visit would have been.  I had been procrastinating this visit and tried to self diagnose by myself for quite some time.  I had replaced my router/modem with a new router/modem and have bought multiple new Ethernet cables.  The only thing i will note is I do run a 100ft cat6 ethernet from my first floor to my upstairs room, however I happen to play alot of mobile games and notice that when I do receive micro-disconnections it affects both my wifi and computers downstairs right next to my router/modem.  At this point my scheduled visit is anywhere from 2-4 hours and I was wondering if anyone has some advice as to what I can do to point out a specific problem to a technician who probably won't be able to care enough a micro-disconnection that to any person watching youtube all day wouldn't notice, but to me who watches and tries to livestream consistently gets disconnected from games and such livestreaming services.  I have 250mbs/10mbs dl/up and live in Massachusetts in a decently popular suburban area.  Current Modem/Router is a Asus - AC2600 CM-32, and I had an Arris sbg6580 in the past.

"Data caps outside of TB regions?My family is possibly looking to change to (unfortunately) Comcast, because it and the local ISP that offers blazing speeds from 1999 are the only options.  The only reason we haven't switched is the local ISP has no data cap.

"Getting charged for professional install due to previous wiring for DirectTvI recently became a Comcast customer for the first time ever. I bought a modem/router combo and did the self install. Internet did not work. I ended up having a tech come out, who had to do something outside, and said it didn't work because the previous tenant was wired for DirectTv and he had to switch out the cables. Comcast ended up charging me the $60 professional installation fee because of this. I called and complained, and they took off $25 from the fee, but they said that was the absolute best I could do. And a credit for the full $60 was denied. I found a link to a post here

Where someone has the exact same issue, and a comcast employee responded saying they would waive the fee.

Do I have any recourse in this case. I feel really taken advantage of, especially since I am a new customer.

Everything else sucks. Pings to the east coast can get up to 500ms, gaming sucks, streaming often buffers, downloads fail, etc. I connect to a different paid ISP's VPN which is about 50 miles (Santa Rosa, Ca.) away and all is good. Why would adding an addition step in the middle make it faster? I want to say they're throttling because when I connect to the VPN they can't see where I'm connecting other than the VPN's IP. But I don't want to go there so maybe they're just incompetent.

"Please Help a Lonely Soldier Fight an Unholy WarForeward: The following has taken place over 29 calls on my cellphone, and an unknown number from my computer, I have never yelled at any agent I have talked to and have been very gracious that they are taking the time to help me with my problem.

June 14th, 2018 - Called into Comcast, spoke with Jermon Raymond who went by ""Darnell"", he quoted me a package for

-Gigabit Internet
-Starter Channel Package
-All of the premium channels (starz, hbo, cinemax, etc) included for free
-An HD DVR Box and an HD receiver for our 2 TV's
-Half Price Installation
-Locked pricing for 24 months

for a price of $110.00 pre-tax (approximately $130 post tax)

June 16th, 2018 - Reached out to Jermon to get everything finalized and get a contract written up, never got a response

June 19th, 2018 - Reached out to Jermon again letting him know that if wanted his commission I would wait for him, but I needed to get this finalized in the next day or 2. I received a response and I signed the customer consent form for the exact package he quoted me initially. I checked this line by line and everything was correct; I was then told that I would receive a copy of the contract in my email which never happened, not to my email, the account holder's email, or the new Xfinity email. We scheduled an install date of July 21st between 1:00pm and 3:00pm

July 21st 2018 - Technicians showed up on site at 2:00pm and reviewed the work order with me; they said they were there to install gigabit internet and 1 non-DVR television box that only supported standard definition. I informed them that a mistake had been made somewhere on their end so they called back in to the office and tried to get everything sorted out. The ""fix"" that was offered to us was to add all of the items that I had signed up for and to charge me $185 / month instead of the original $110 I had signed the contract for. This was obviously unacceptable so we ended up postponing the install until I sorted everything out.

3:00 pm - Called in to the no-wait hotline and explained the situation to a woman who's name I did not catch, I gave her the information required to pull the phone recording of the initial conversation with Jermon in order to set this straight; she did not even acknowledge this as an option and then she then transferred me to a sales rep named Jessica who essentially told me there was nothing she could do and that she would be transferring me to an escalation agent. After being on hold quite a while, I was informed that they were busy and would call me back by 5:00pm at the absolute latest.

5:30 pm - Never received a call from the escalation tech, was starting to get worried so I called back in to the no-wait hotline and spoke to a rep named Sean. Sean told me that there was no ticket ever created to call me back, nor were there any notes in my account to do so. I explained my situation to him and he was able to get me close to what I was originally quoted ($139.89 / month), which frankly is still unacceptable after I had already signed a contract, but I was so fed up with everything I said whatever. He then sent me another contract which I signed and have a copy of and set an install date of July 30th, but he was going to put a ticket in for installation ASAP. I figured we were out of the woods, but then he was having problems rescheduling the install due to the original work order not being completed. He ended up having to call me back as he could not figure out how to accomplish what he was trying to do in the system without a supervisor.

6:30 pm - Sean called me back to inform me that he was still working through the problem and he would be in touch later that night.

8:00 pm - Sean called back again to say that he could not make the system do what he needed it to do in order to schedule the job so I would receive a call from one of the escalation reps within the next 2 days. I verified again at this point that there would be no issue with the contract and as soon as they figured out how to get it scheduled we would be on our way, which he confirmed across the board. He also stated that I would be receiving a free installation due to excessive amount of trouble I was having.

July 22nd, 2018 - The escalation rep, named Gale, called me at 3:30pm and started to question what I was trying to do with this ticket, he then said that he couldn't figure out how to add codes to the account to get the price down (I'm not sure why he was messing with this at all). After I told him all I needed was for the job to be scheduled he told me that he couldn't figure out the price stuff so, ""I'm going to have to pay more"", which was just mind-boggling. I told him that was not going to work, and that they would need to figure out a solution. He told me that I would be hearing from him soon and offered to send me his contact information, I agreed and gave him my e-mail. I never received the aforementioned contact information, nor a call.

July 23rd, 2018 - 8:00pm Spoke with a rep named Javier; he ran into an issue getting promo codes to work, he's getting an error saying that the promotion is not valid with the equipment on the account. He thinks it is because the installation was postponed and there no equipment on on site. I requested to have the ticket reassigned from Gale (the executive care relations rep) due to a lack of confidence in his ability to get the job done. Javier has put a note in his calendar to follow up on the ticket on July 24th and collaborate with Sean as well. Javier e-mailed all executive care relations supervisors in order to get this taken care of as quickly as possible, he also noted that our AT&T Contract expires on the 27th of July and stated that the executive care reps should be able to get the install taken care of ASAP as they have more power to adjust the installation techs' schedules

July 24th, 2018 - Did not hear from Javi by 12:00 pm so I called back in to the ONIT number and got in touch with him, he managed to setup an installation appointment for the 24th of July (today) for 5:00pm - 7:00pm and assured me that once the equipment was installed that he would be able to enter the promotional codes to get my price back down to the price I had previously agreed to on the customer consent form and any additional charges would be refunded.

I received a call from the dispatch agent, Al, later in the day (approximately 3:00pm) informing me that he knew that this was a massive problem ticket and assuring me that there would be no issue, the tech knew it was an install job, and that he would be there as soon as possible.

5:15 - I received a text stating that the technician had arrived, which I thought was odd as I was standing in my garage waiting for him. Shortly after, I received an automated phone call stating that I should go out and meet the technician as he was looking for me, obviously, he was not there. I called the ONIT line again to let them know what was going on in hopes of them reaching the technician, the rep I spoke to said that there was nothing that she could do as they don't have a contact number for dispatch, she made a ticket and told me she would call back. About 10 minutes later I received another automated call informing me that the technician had left the site and that my appointment was cancelled. I thought it was very odd that he never called me to get my location, or that he couldn't find the house in the first place as the technician who was scheduled to do the initial install had no problem and there is no issue finding my residence on google maps. Immediately after, I called the ONIT line and requested to speak to Sean or Javi to inform them of what happened; I was transferred to Sean who could not believe what happened. He, again, apologized profusely for the utterly abysmal service I had been receiving and promptly submitted another ticket informing dispatch that the tech was to complete an install for 2 tv's and the internet and then proceeded to schedule another appointment for July 25th (tomorrow) at 1:00pm - 3:00pm as I told him I would stay home from work that day. He also told me that even if the work order was incorrect, to allow the tech to install the equipment at the higher price and he would manually credit the account each month until a permanent solution was found (this was approved by his manager and is noted in the account). I thanked him again for his continued determination and asked to speak to his manager. Sean transferred me to his manager who's name I believe was Kyle, and I proceeded to tell him what an awful experience this whole process had been, but informed him that Javi and Sean are all-star employees and are the only reason I had not given up and just cancelled my account.

July 25th, 2018 - Technician (Preston Wilson) showed up on site at approximately 1:30pm, met him in the driveway and we exchanged information. He told me that he was there on a support call, not an installation call, and that he didn't have time to complete an installation. I asked him to call dispatch and try to get things straightened out while I called the ONIT line again and tried to work through that avenue. ONIT, again, told me that they did not have a direct line with dispatch, but that they did see that the ticket that was sent to them did indeed mention that it was for an install and not a support call. After I got off the phone with ONIT, I spoke with the tech who said his dispatcher (Nick) told him that there was nothing he could do and to just leave. I told the tech that this was completely unacceptable as this was the 3rd time they were on site for a routine install and that he would more than likely be losing a customer if he just left without resolving anything, he didn't care at all and just left. I called ONIT again and got in touch with Javi and explained what happened. Again, he could not believe what had happened; he said he was going to dig into it and get back to me. At this point I was at my wit's end with the amount of incompetence I had been subjected to and began tweeting at Comcast / Xfinity as well as posting on their facebook wall. While I was in the midst of this I received a call from Gale (the first since when he told me that, ""I was just going to have to pay more""); Gale told me he had been working on my ticket the past few days, when I had inquired as to why I hadn't heard from him at all he said that he had other customers he had to deal with. It was at this point I told him that I knew he was lying as Javi and Sean had informed me that he had been out of office as they too, had been trying to get in touch with him, he told me that he had a ""Family Emergency"" and never even apologized for lying to me. I then asked him why he had never sent over his contact information after he had offered it to me, he said he had, and I told him to go back and look at his sent emails, at which point he acknowledged that he had not ever sent them to me. Gale offered me another flimsy promise of him being there ready to take care of it and make sure it worked out next time, he had cancelled the account I had been working with and that had all of my ticket information and notes in it and had created a new one for me, following this, his solution to my problem was an installation date of August 1st, which I told him was not going to be acceptable as my AT&T contract was expiring on the 27th of July and that I would be without any service at all. Just to note, I scheduled the initial install for the 21st of July just in case there were any bumps in the road that might delay the setup process and had made it crystal clear to Comcast that I absolutely needed to be up and running by then, to which they assured me would absolutely not be an issue. Well, Gale didn't think that was important and told me there was nothing he could do and I would just have to live with August 1st. I was furious at point and told him to schedule it as a backup, but I would be getting it changed. During the phone call with Gale, I was also speaking with the social media agents; nothing noteworthy was said as they could not comprehend the situation and refused to call me to get it sorted out. They offered me free HBO for 24 months and a free install as compensation, to which I replied that I had already been promised that. After I got off the phone with Gale, I found the number for the Comcast corporate HQ and called them up. I explained my situation to the man who answered, he was taken aback when every piece of advice he offered me was met with a defeated, ""Yea, I already tried that."" After he exhausted every suggestion he could give me, he told me, to my dismay, that Gale was the most powerful person in this whole situation and when I explained how unreliable he had been, he suggested that I submit a report to the Better Business Bureau as incidents raised by them must be resolved within 2 days (which is where this novel is headed). After getting off the phone with corporate, I got in touch with Javi again, who told me, contrary to Gale, that he would get a ticket into dispatch to get another early install and that I would be hearing back from somebody by 9:30pm today at the latest. It is 9:10pm as of writing this update and I have not heard back, nor do I expect to. I will be continuing this unholy war as I have been, any updates from myself will be available upon request.",Comcast
"Hooray! The Comcast Witch Is Dead!I was a loyal Comcast customer for 16 years.  During that time, I spent $38,400  as their customer.  Then they decided to start charging overage fees.  They claimed that they warned, us, and they may very well have, but we never saw the warnings.  They charged us over $400 in overages for using what they termed was too much data.

When I called to find out what was going on, they refused to help me.  They said that in addition to warning us, they had already waived the overage charges once.  Again, something that could very well be true, but given the lack of communication, we had no idea.

It's all good Comcast!  Because I just dumped you!!  And guess what; I am getting 100 times the speed (10 gigs up and down) for 1/8th the monthly cost ($25 a month).  

Life's a bitch when your competitor is a fiber optic network...

Perhaps next time don't treat a loyal customer so badly... or do... I really don't care, because though I don't hold a grudge, I have no incentive to ever come back.  You see, your refusal to credit me $400 woke me up and got me to research your competitors, and to discover that I can get a SIGNIFICANTLY faster connection for a fraction of the cost.  

Unless you intend to increase your own speeds by 100 times, while dropping your price by 88% then you are not likely to ever get me back.

Now to post this on facebook, where I am friends with many of my neighbors.  I wonder how many of them are unaware how much faster and cheaper the local fiber optic company is?",Comcast

"Xfinity Internet UnstableFor the past four months, my home internet has become unstable.  The upstream will drop occasionally, for about 5-30 seconds at random throughout the day (on average, about 15-50 times spread out), and it's incredibly frustrating when you are gaming or trying to use a smart device and the net just drops for a moment.

At first, I figured the modem/router may be the culprit, so I looked into the new gigabit service and figured I might as well go all out and upgrade.  I purchased the NetGear CM1000 (Comcast approved gigabit modem) and a gigabit Edge-Router (ER-X).

Since then, we've had a total of 9 technicians come out to the house, redo the lines, connections and adjust the signal.  When the net works, it's great (speed test around 900 Mbps), and haven't had any real issues outside of the unstable drops.  I have a log setup on the router that pings google's DNS and reports when the net goes down, and it's like a christmas tree to say the least.

I keep calling out techs and speaking with the live chat reps to schedule appointments and ask for my account to be credited for the days, but this is becoming such a hassle.  Each tech that comes out, I explain the situation in great detail, they check the signal and the lines then claim the node is fine, and the problem must lie either on my computer, or my network setup (which is untrue, as the setup is completely new, and just a simple wired connection).  What more can I do but continuing to call our service technicians like I'm cursed to have bad internet forever?

"Comcast fucked us over when we moved and we now owe them almost $300 for literally nothing and the refuse to refund us.So we moved in May.

And here is where the royal fuck up begins. 

When they switched our service over they created an entire new account without telling us.

My fiancé works from home some days, this this completely screwed him over. Not to mention we thought we had been paying for our service. And we had! At our previous house! We paid for two months of service at a house we didn’t live in and owed almost $200 on an account we didn’t know existed! After being on the phone with Comcast for maybe a total of six hours, half of that time was either on hold or the call dropped so we had to call them back again, we ultimately gave up and went straight into a Comcast store to yell at them in person because even when calling during their billing departments business hours, we were still told it was closed. 

So we go in in person, get told we MIGHT get a refund, and after waiting two more days, the refund got denied! So we are trying again. :)

I hate Comcast so much. Every other internet provider in the area only offers 20mbps, Comcast offers 300. They are pretty much our only option and they are trying to fuck us over on ridiculous charges, turning off our internet every couple days, and refusing refunds on shit that is 100% THEIR FAULT. We are two college students with massive debt, we have been living paycheck to paycheck as it is, how can they expect us to pay this? I’m literally out of options other than call them for a thousandth time and hope that maybe this time around they will give us our money back. ",Comcast

"Comcast Data Usage is definitely wrongI saw a few other posts on here regarding data usage but didn't see a resolution, so I figured i'd share my story.

I signed up for comcast about 2 weeks ago and they are saying im over my data limit. I have the 150 down package (and actually get 160, high five)

It's the 12th day of the month and i've ""used"" 1233 gb of data according to comcast. That's right, a family of 2 with no kids and minimal downloading has used 100 gb of data per day.

Laughably high, right?

We watch netflix most days and have YouTube TV, but all in, we probably watch 2 hours of TV per day. By everything im seeing on the internet, that's about 7gb per hour at the very max (4k), so let's assume 20gb for TV. That still leaves 80gb unaccounted for.

Here's the thing. I have Google WiFi and it tracks EVERYTHING. According to Google, i've only used 350 gb of data (30/day), which I totally believe.

So essentially comcast is saying im using the data and i have proof that im not. Any ideas? I can see every device connected to my wifi so as far as im aware, there isn't anyone leaching my wifi. That and I live in the suburbs, so unlikely anyway.",Comcast
"Maybe it is just me, but Instant TV sucksI have my own modem/router and subscribe to $49.95  HSD Perfomance starter (15Mbps).

I tried the Xfinity Instant TV ($18), and it was just awful.

The thing that turned me off the most was the same channels over and over in the guide. I add say NBC HD, and there is like 6 of them in SD and HD. There was no way to add just the one particular HD channel that I wanted without adding duplicates...you add one, it adds them all. 

For example, I added local News channel, HD versions of NBC, FOX, CBS, ABC, CW, PBS, and some non-HD like Comet, AntennaTV, COZI, Bounce, Heros & Icons, and ION.
 
But instead of having just 13 channels in the guide...I had over a 50 channels in my guide. PITA to surf through.

The other non-HD channels like Comet, Antenna TV, etc., were so bad in quality they were almost unwatchable. Res was way under 480 (SD).

I couldn't even get through two weeks before I canceled Xfinity InstantTV. The 20 hours DVR was bad, but doable with ondemand. But the overall experience was not one which I want to ever repeat.

Don't waste your money. You can get more for your buck (live cable and ondemand network tv for nearly the same price)

In the end,  I just added the following apps to my 3 Roku devices on our 3 HDTVs for live and ondemand tv...much better deal ($22/month total cost).

* Philo ($16) live and ondemand streaming cable TV
* CBS All Access ($6) live CBS and ondemand
* NBC free ondemand
* ABC free ondemand
* FOXNOW free ondemand
* The CW free ondemand
*  COMET free live tv (kinda like a free SYFY channel)
* ROKU CHANNEL (kinda like having free Netflix/Crackle)

* MLB.tv free live and ondemand MLB baseball (free account users get 1 free game everyday, and T-Mobile customers get all games free via tmobile tuesdays premium 1yr subscription)

Yeah, called to cancel my xfinity home security because it’s not REALLY a security system only used it for automation I have a German Shepherd for the other things, so signed the 2 year contract when it was installed like 5 years ago. When I was cancelling the only Comcast/xfinity item left the customer service rep was like “oh you also have an early termination fee” I said “no I don’t, I signed up for xfinity home almost 5 years ago and if the contract is longer than 2 years that’s against Illinois utility code law”. She told me that when I called to cancel my internet (since their packet quality is terrible, yeah speed test says real good but the actually data is garbage) they automatically repackaged me and renewed another agreement/contract for 2 years. She said I’d have to call another person Bc the computer automatically generates a early termination fee. Are they serious? First of all the thought that Comcast/xfinity actually owns a cellular network for cell phones is a joke. Can’t believe the FCC even let them do that considering they can’t get a handle on the existing customer service they have.

Slightly long post, but my house is something like 1/4 of a mile away from the nearest main street. It currently has Verizon but it's absolutely terrible DSL. I had a Comcast technician come out to give me a quote for laying coax cable to the house....and I almost fainted. $26,000!! Obviously, that will not be happening.
My question is, does anyone know if they would be okay with me laying the cable myself? A number of my friends are experienced electricians / contractors and we have the machinery to dig a suitable trench.

Any help would be greatly appreciated!

"Considering ditching rental modem/router, need adviceHi! I currently have the Xfinity Performance Internet package (up to 60 mbps) at promo price of $39.99 ($29.99 with self-service discount). I am also paying $11 for equipment rental - the Arris TG1682G. I have no complaints with either the internet or the router/modem other than the $11 per month I've spent for the past year. I'm looking at returning the equipment and getting my own router and modem (separate, since that seems to be the recommendation). 

I live in an apartment, roughly 1200 sq ft, two floors. The modem/router is downstairs in living room, allowing me to have my PS4, Switch, and Wii U to connect via ethernet. WiFi is used for iPhones, laptops, and fire stick. I have no trouble right now with the WiFi connecting upstairs. I've already been here for almost a year and will be here for at least one more (grad school). 

I've found a combo on Amazon for a Netgear CM500 modem and AC1750 router for $110, which seems like a good deal to me considering that's less than one year of renting from Comcast and it seems to have good reviews. Here's the link (it's the fourth option down):

1) Is this a good choice? I was also considering the Arris SB6183 + a fairly cheap router (never settled on one). I'm open to other recommendations, but I'd like to stay under $150.

2) What is going to happen when my ""promotional period"" ends? How much will my bill increase, and is there anything I can do about it?
